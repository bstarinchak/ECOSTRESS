	abstract = {This study used high-precision radiocarbon bomb-pulse dating of selected wood rings to provide an independent validation of the tree growth periodicity of Pseudolmedia rigida (Klotzsch \& H. Karst) Cuatrec. from the Moraceae family, collected in the Madidi National Park in Bolivia. 14C content was measured by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) in 10 samples from a single tree covering over 70 yr from 1939 to 2011. These preliminary calendar dates were determined by dendrochronological techniques and were also used to select the samples for 14C AMS. In order to validate these preliminary dates using the established Southern Hemisphere (SH) 14C atmospheric concentration data set, the targeted rings were selected to be formed during periods before and after the 14C bomb spike nuclear tests (i.e. 1950s--1960s). The excellent agreement of the dendrochronological dates and the 14C signatures in tree rings associated with the same dates provided by the bomb-pulse 14C atmospheric values for the SH (SHCal zone 1--2) confirms the annual periodicity of the observed growth layers, and thus the high potential of this species for tree-ring analysis. The lack of discrepancies between both data sets also suggests that there are no significant latitudinal differences between the 14C SHCal zone 1--2 curve and the 14C values obtained from the selected tree rings at this geographic location (14$\,^{\circ}$33′S, 68$\,^{\circ}$49′W) in South America. The annual resolution of P. rigida tree rings opens the possibility of broader applications of dendrochronological analysis for ecological and paleoclimatic studies in the Bolivian tropics, as well as the possibility of using wood samples from some tree species from this region to improve the quality of the bomb-pulse 14C SHCal curve at this latitude.},

@article{De-Schepper:2013ud,
	abstract = {It is generally believed that an osmotically generated pressure gradient drives the phloem mass flow. So far, this widely accepted M{\"u}nch theory has required remarkably few adaptations, but the debate on alternative and additional hypotheses is still ongoing. Recently, a possible shortcoming of the M{\"u}nch theory has been pointed out, suggesting that the M{\"u}nch pressure flow is more suitable for herbs than for trees. Estimation of the phloem resistance indicates that a point might be reached in long sieve tubes where the pressure required to drive the M{\"u}nch flow cannot be generated. Therefore, the relay hypothesis regained belief as it implies that the sieve tubes are shorter then the plant's axial axis. In the source phloem, three different loading strategies exist which probably result from evolutionary advantages. Passive diffusion seems to be the most primitive one, whereas active loading strategies substantially increase the growth potential. Along the transport phloem, a leakage-retrieval mechanism is observed. Appreciable amounts of carbohydrates are lost from the sieve tubes to feed the lateral sinks, while a part of these lost carbohydrates is subsequently reloaded into the sieve tubes. This mechanism is probably involved to buffer short-term irregularities in phloem turgor and gradient. In the long term, the mechanism controls the replenishment and remobilization of lateral stem storage tissues. As phloem of higher plants has multiple functions in plant development, reproduction, signalling, and growth, the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind phloem transport should be elucidated to increase our ability to influence plant growth and development.},

@article{VAN-BEL:1990uk,
	abstract = {{$[$}The radial solute exchange between xylem and phloem is an important determinant of the natrient distribution and C/N economy of seed plants. Nevertheless, our knowledge of the mechanism of xylem---phloem exchange is very limited. This paper aims to integrate anatomical and physiological data about xylem---phloem exchange and focuses on the mechanisms of radial transport. Electrophysiological mapping and intracellular injection of fluorescent dyes demonstrate that stem tissue is organized in symplastic subunits specialized in either longitudinal or lateral transport. Radial orientation, anatomical and physiological organization, strong metabolic activities, relatively negative membrane potentials, and high capacities of uptake make the rays the most likely routes for symplastic xylem-to-phloem transport. Parallel apoplastic transport may occur through radial canacules between the ray cells. The symplastic xylem-to-phloem transport includes a number of steps: (a) passage across the vessel/parenchyma interface, (b) transfer in the ray, and (c) delivery from the ray into the sieve tube/companion cell complex. Large contact pits in the vessel walls give access to the ray cells, by which the solutes are accumulated through substrate/proton co-transport. Dense pitting on the tangential walls and other ultrastructural features suggest preferential symplastic transport in the radial direction. Auxiliary endo/exocytosis is under dispute. The transport step from the ray to the sieve tube/companion cell complex remains to be elucidated. In phloem-to-xylem transport, the unloading from the phloem along the stem is essentially apoplastic, but under specific conditions it may be symplastic. Further transfer to the xylem probably occurs via the symplastic route through the ray. During radial transport, important metabolic interconversions take place into either transport or storage compounds. In many trees, the metabolism of the ray cells undergoes cyclic, annual fluctuations. Complex season-bound deposition/mobilization processes in the ray cells corresponding with seasonal changes in membrane permeability and cellular organization, reflect a master-system designed to co-ordinate the C/N economy throughout the year.{$]$}},

@article{Kim:2017wz,
	abstract = {Carbohydrates are the primary energy source for plant development. Plants synthesize sucrose in source organs and transport them to sink organs during plant growth. This metabolism is sensitive to environmental changes in light quantity, quality, and photoperiod. In the daytime, the synthesis of sucrose and starch accumulates, and starch is degraded at nighttime. The circadian clock genes provide plants with information on the daily environmental changes and directly control many developmental processes, which are related to the path of primary metabolites throughout the life cycle. The circadian clock mechanism and processes of metabolism controlled by the circadian rhythm were studied in the model plant Arabidopsis and in the crops potato and rice. However, the translation of molecular mechanisms obtained from studies of model plants to crop plants is still difficult. Crop plants have specific organs such as edible seed and tuber that increase the size or accumulate valuable metabolites by harvestable metabolic components. Human consumers are interested in the regulation and promotion of these agriculturally significant crops. Circadian clock manipulation may suggest various strategies for the increased productivity of food crops through using environmental signal or overcoming environmental stress.},

@article{Helm:2021tl,
	abstract = {Tree stem CO2 efflux is an important component of ecosystem carbon fluxes and has been the focus of many studies. While CO2 efflux can easily be measured, a growing number of studies have shown that it is not identical with actual in situ respiration. Complementing measurements of CO2 flux with simultaneous measurements of O2 flux provides an additional proxy for respiration, and the combination of both fluxes can potentially help getting closer to actual measures of respiratory fluxes. To date, however, the technical challenge to measure relatively small changes in O2 concentration against its high atmospheric background has prevented routine O2 measurements in field applications.Here we present a new and low-cost field-tested device for autonomous real-time and quasi-continuous long-term measurements of stem respiration by combining CO2 (NDIR based) and O2 (quenching based) sensors in a tree stem chamber. Our device operates as a cyclic closed system and measures changes in both CO2 and O2 concentration within the chamber over time. The device is battery-powered with a {$>$} 1 week power independence and data acquisition is conveniently achieved by an internal logger. Results from both field and laboratory tests document that our sensors provide reproducible measurements of CO2 and O2 exchange fluxes under varying environmental conditions.},

@article{Brando:2019,
	abstract = {Abstract Drought, fire, and windstorms can interact to degrade tropical forests and the ecosystem services they provide, but how these forests recover after catastrophic disturbance events remains relatively unknown. Here, we analyze multi-year measurements of vegetation dynamics and function (fluxes of CO2 and H2O) in forests recovering from 7 years of controlled burns, followed by wind disturbance. Located in southeast Amazonia, the experimental forest consists of three 50-ha plots burned annually, triennially, or not at all from 2004 to 2010. During the subsequent 6-year recovery period, postfire tree survivorship and biomass sharply declined, with aboveground C stocks decreasing by 70\%--94\% along forest edges (0--200 m into the forest) and 36\%--40\% in the forest interior. Vegetation regrowth in the forest understory triggered partial canopy closure (70\%--80\%) from 2010 to 2015. The composition and spatial distribution of grasses invading degraded forest evolved rapidly, likely because of the delayed mortality. Four years after the experimental fires ended (2014), the burned plots assimilated 36\% less carbon than the Control, but net CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration (ET) had fully recovered 7 years after the experimental fires ended (2017). Carbon uptake recovery occurred largely in response to increased light-use efficiency and reduced postfire respiration, whereas increased water use associated with postfire growth of new recruits and remaining trees explained the recovery in ET. Although the effects of interacting disturbances (e.g., fires, forest fragmentation, and blowdown events) on mortality and biomass persist over many years, the rapid recovery of carbon and water fluxes can help stabilize local climate.},

@article{Dandrea:2019,
	abstract = {Summary Late frost can destroy the photosynthetic apparatus of trees. We hypothesized that this can alter the normal cyclic dynamics of C-reserves in the wood. We measured soluble sugar concentrations and radiocarbon signatures (Δ14C) of soluble nonstructural carbon (NSC) in woody tissues sampled from a Mediterranean beech forest that was completely defoliated by an exceptional late frost in 2016. We used the bomb radiocarbon approach to estimate the time elapsed since fixation of mobilized soluble sugars. During the leafless period after the frost event, soluble sugar concentrations declined sharply while Δ14C of NSC increased. This can be explained by the lack of fresh assimilate supply and a mobilization of C from reserve pools. Soluble NSC became increasingly older during the leafless period, with a maximum average age of 5 yr from samples collected 27 d before canopy recovery. Following leaf re-growth, soluble sugar concentrations increased and Δ14C of soluble NSC decreased, indicating the allocation of new assimilates to the stem soluble sugars pool. These data highlight that beech trees rapidly mobilize reserve C to survive strong source--sink imbalances, for example due to late frost, and show that NSC is a key trait for tree resilience under global change.},

@article{DAndrea:2020,
	abstract = {Abstract The effects of short-term extreme events on tree functioning and physiology are still rather elusive. European beech is one of the most sensitive species to late frost and water shortage. We investigated the intra-annual C dynamics in stems under such conditions. Wood formation and stem CO2 efflux were monitored in a Mediterranean beech forest for 3 years (2015--2017), including a late frost (2016) and a summer drought (2017). The late frost reduced radial growth and, consequently, the amount of carbon fixed in the stem biomass by 80\%. Stem carbon dioxide efflux in 2016 was reduced by 25\%, which can be attributed to the reduction of effluxes due to growth respiration. Counter to our expectations, we found no effects of the 2017 summer drought on radial growth and stem carbon efflux. The studied extreme weather events had various effects on tree growth. Even though late spring frost had a strong impact on beech radial growth in the current year, trees fully recovered in the following growing season, indicating high resilience of beech to this stressful event.},

@article{Bloemen:2013,
	abstract = {Summary Upward transport of CO2 via the transpiration stream from belowground to aboveground tissues occurs in tree stems. Despite potentially important implications for our understanding of plant physiology, the fate of internally transported CO2 derived from autotrophic respiratory processes remains unclear. We infused a 13CO2-labeled aqueous solution into the base of 7-yr-old field-grown eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) trees to investigate the effect of xylem-transported CO2 derived from the root system on aboveground carbon assimilation and CO2 efflux. The 13C label was transported internally and detected throughout the tree. Up to 17\% of the infused label was assimilated, while the remainder diffused to the atmosphere via stem and branch efflux. The largest amount of assimilated 13C was found in branch woody tissues, while only a small quantity was assimilated in the foliage. Petioles were more highly enriched in 13C than other leaf tissues. Our results confirm a recycling pathway for respired CO2 and indicate that internal transport of CO2 from the root system may confound the interpretation of efflux-based estimates of woody tissue respiration and patterns of carbohydrate allocation.},

@article{Poorter:2007,
	abstract = {In many plant communities, there is a negative interspecific correlation between relative growth rates and survival of juveniles. This negative correlation is most likely caused by a trade-off between carbon allocation to growth vs. allocation to defense and storage. Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) stored in stems allow plants to overcome periods of stress and should enhance survival. In order to assess how species differ in carbohydrate storage in relation to juvenile light requirements, growth, and survival, we quantified NSC concentrations and pool sizes in sapling stems of 85 woody species in moist semi-evergreen and dry deciduous tropical forests in the rainy season in Bolivia. Moist forest species averaged higher NSC concentrations than dry forest species. Carbohydrate concentrations and pool sizes decreased with the light requirements of juveniles of the species in the moist forest but not in the dry forest. Combined, these results suggest that storage is especially important for species that regenerate in persistently shady habitats, as in the understory of moist evergreen forests. For moist forest species, sapling survival rates increased with NSC concentrations and pool sizes while growth rates declined with the NSC concentrations and pool sizes. No relationships were found for dry forest species. Carbon allocation to storage contributes to the growth--survival trade-off through its positive effect on survival. And, a continuum in carbon storage strategies contributes to a continuum in light requirements among species. The link between storage and light requirements is especially strong in moist evergreen forest where species sort out along a light gradient, but disappears in dry deciduous forest where light is a less limiting resource and species sort out along drought and fire gradients.},

@article{Reich:2014,
	abstract = {Summary The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water -- the third key resource --stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources. Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages). There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species. Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up -- fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates. Synthesis. Traits matter. A single `fast--slow' plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Wood performs several essential functions in plants, including mechanically supporting aboveground tissue, storing water and other resources, and transporting sap. Woody tissues are likely to face physiological, structural and defensive trade-offs. How a plant optimizes among these competing functions can have major ecological implications, which have been under-appreciated by ecologists compared to the focus they have given to leaf function. To draw together our current understanding of wood function, we identify and collate data on the major wood functional traits, including the largest wood density database to date (8412 taxa), mechanical strength measures and anatomical features, as well as clade-specific features such as secondary chemistry. We then show how wood traits are related to one another, highlighting functional trade-offs, and to ecological and demographic plant features (growth form, growth rate, latitude, ecological setting). We suggest that, similar to the manifold that tree species leaf traits cluster around the `leaf economics spectrum', a similar `wood economics spectrum' may be defined. We then discuss the biogeography, evolution and biogeochemistry of the spectrum, and conclude by pointing out the major gaps in our current knowledge of wood functional traits.},

@article{Diaz:2004,
	abstract = {Abstract Question: A set of easily-measured (`soft') plant traits has been identified as potentially useful predictors of ecosystem functioning in previous studies. Here we aimed to discover whether the screening techniques remain operational in widely contrasted circumstances, to test for the existence of axes of variation in the particular sets of traits, and to test for their links with `harder' traits of proven importance to ecosystem functioning. Location: central-western Argentina, central England, northern upland Iran, and north-eastern Spain. Recurrent patterns of ecological specialization: Through ordination of a matrix of 640 vascular plant taxa by 12 standardized traits, we detected similar patterns of specialization in the four floras. The first PCA axis was identified as an axis of resource capture, usage and release. PCA axis 2 appeared to be a size-related axis. Individual PCA for each country showed that the same traits remained valuable as predictors of resource capture and utilization in all of them, despite their major differences in climate, biogeography and land-use. The results were not significantly driven by particular taxa: the main traits determining PCA axis 1 were very similar in eudicotyledons and monocotyledons and Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae. Links between recurrent suites of `soft' traits and `hard' traits: The validity of PCA axis 1 as a key predictor of resource capture and utilization was tested by comparisons between this axis and values of more rigorously established predictors (`hard' traits) for the floras of Argentina and England. PCA axis 1 was correlated with variation in relative growth rate, leaf nitrogen content, and litter decomposition rate. It also coincided with palatability to model generalist herbivores. Therefore, location on PCA axis 1 can be linked to major ecosystem processes in those habitats where the plants are dominant. Conclusion: We confirm the existence at the global scale of a major axis of evolutionary specialization, previously recognised in several local floras. This axis reflects a fundamental trade-off between rapid acquisition of resources and conservation of resources within well-protected tissues. These major trends of specialization were maintained across different environmental situations (including differences in the proximate causes of low productivity, i.e. drought or mineral nutrient deficiency). The trends were also consistent across floras and major phylogenetic groups, and were linked with traits directly relevant to ecosystem processes.},

@article{Klein:2016,
	abstract = {Summary The carbon sink intensity of the biosphere depends on the balance between gross primary productivity (GPP) of forest canopies and ecosystem respiration. GPP, however, cannot be directly measured and estimates are not well constrained. A new approach relying on canopy transpiration flux measured as sap flow, and water-use efficiency inferred from carbon isotope analysis (GPPSF) has been proposed, but not tested against eddy covariance-based estimates (GPPEC). Here we take advantage of parallel measurements using the two approaches at a semi-arid pine forest site to compare the GPPSF and GPPEC estimates on diurnal to annual timescales. GPPSF captured the seasonal dynamics of GPPEC (GPPSF = 0.99 × GPPEC, r2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.82, n = 457 d) with good agreement at the annual timescale (653 vs 670 g C m−2 yr−1). Both methods showed that GPP ranged between 1 and 8 g C m−2 d−1, and the GPPSF/GPPEC ratio was between 0.5 and 2.0 during 82\% of the days. Carbon uptake dynamics at the individual tree scale conformed with leaf scale rates of net assimilation. GPPSF can produce robust estimations of tree- and canopy-scale rates of CO2 uptake, providing constraints and greatly extending current GPPEC estimations.},

Our data highlight three trends: (1) there is differing seasonality of total net primary productivity (NPP) with the highlands and dry lowlands peaking in the dry season and the humid lowland sites peaking in the wet season, (2) seasonal reductions in wood NPP are not driven by reductions in total NPP but by carbon during the dry season being preferentially allocated toward either roots or canopy NPP, and (3) there is a temporal decoupling between total photosynthesis and total carbon usage (plant carbon expenditure). This decoupling indicates the presence of nonstructural carbohydrates which may allow growth and carbon to be allocated when it is most ecologically beneficial rather than when it is most environmentally available.},

@article{Girardin:2016,
	abstract = {Abstract The seasonality of solar irradiance and precipitation may regulate seasonal variations in tropical forests carbon cycling. Controversy remains over their importance as drivers of seasonal dynamics of net primary productivity in tropical forests. We use ground data from nine lowland Amazonian forest plots collected over 3 years to quantify the monthly primary productivity (NPP) of leaves, reproductive material, woody material, and fine roots over an annual cycle. We distinguish between forests that do not experience substantial seasonal moisture stress (``humid sites'') and forests that experience a stronger dry season (``dry sites''). We find that forests from both precipitation regimes maximize leaf NPP over the drier season, with a peak in production in August at both humid (mean 0.39 $\pm$ 0.03 Mg C ha−1 month−1 in July, n = 4) and dry sites (mean 0.49 $\pm$ 0.03 Mg C ha−1 month−1 in September, n = 8). We identify two distinct seasonal carbon allocation patterns (the allocation of NPP to a specific organ such as wood leaves or fine roots divided by total NPP). The forests monitored in the present study show evidence of either (i) constant allocation to roots and a seasonal trade-off between leaf and woody material or (ii) constant allocation to wood and a seasonal trade-off between roots and leaves. Finally, we find strong evidence of synchronized flowering at the end of the dry season in both precipitation regimes. Flower production reaches a maximum of 0.047 $\pm$ 0.013 and 0.031 $\pm$ 0.004 Mg C ha−1 month−1 in November, in humid and dry sites, respectively. Fruitfall production was staggered throughout the year, probably reflecting the high variation in varying times to development and loss of fruit among species.},

	abstract = {Abstract Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) are crucial for forest resilience, but little is known regarding the role of bark in NSC storage. However, bark's abundance in woody stems and its large living fraction make it potentially key for NSC storage. We quantified total NSC, soluble sugar (SS) and starch concentrations in the most living region of bark (inner bark, IB), and sapwood of twigs, trunks and roots of 45 woody species from three contrasting tropical climates spanning global extremes of bark diversity and wide phylogenetic diversity. NSC concentrations were similar (total NSC, starch) or higher (SS) in IB than wood, with concentrations co-varying strongly. NSC concentrations varied widely across organs and species within communities and were not significantly affected by climate, leaf habit or the presence of photosynthetic bark. Starch concentration tended to increase with density, but only in wood. IB contributed substantially to NSC storage, accounting for 17--36\% of total NSC, 23--47\% of SS and 15--33\% of starch pools. Further examination of the drivers of variation in IB NSC concentration, and taking into account the substantial contribution of IB to NSC pools, will be crucial to understand the role of storage in plant environmental adaptation.},

	abstract = {Summary Tropical ecosystems have the highest levels of biodiversity, cycle more water and absorb more carbon than any other terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. Consequently, these ecosystems are extremely important components of Earth's climatic system and biogeochemical cycles. Plant hydraulics is an essential discipline to understand and predict the dynamics of tropical vegetation in scenarios of changing water availability. Using published plant hydraulic data we show that the trade-off between drought avoidance (expressed as deep-rooting, deciduousness and capacitance) and hydraulic safety (P50 -- the water potential when plants lose 50\% of their maximum hydraulic conductivity) is a major axis of physiological variation across tropical ecosystems. We also propose a novel and independent axis of hydraulic trait variation linking vulnerability to hydraulic failure (expressed as the hydraulic safety margin (HSM)) and growth, where inherent fast-growing plants have lower HSM compared to slow-growing plants. We surmise that soil nutrients are fundamental drivers of tropical community assembly determining the distribution and abundance of the slow-safe/fast-risky strategies. We conclude showing that including either the growth-HSM or the resistance-avoidance trade-off in models can make simulated tropical rainforest communities substantially more vulnerable to drought than similar communities without the trade-off. These results suggest that vegetation models need to represent hydraulic trade-off axes to accurately project the functioning and distribution of tropical ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Life-history theory posits that trade-offs between demographic rates constrain the range of viable life-history strategies. For coexisting tropical tree species, the best established demographic trade-off is the growth-survival trade-off. However, we know surprisingly little about co-variation of growth and survival with measures of reproduction. We analysed demographic rates from seed to adult of 282 co-occurring tropical tree and shrub species, including measures of reproduction and accounting for ontogeny. Besides the well-established fast--slow continuum, we identified a second major dimension of demographic variation: a trade-off between recruitment and seedling performance vs. growth and survival of larger individuals (≥ 1 cm dbh) corresponding to a `stature--recruitment' axis. The two demographic dimensions were almost perfectly aligned with two independent trait dimensions (shade tolerance and size). Our results complement recent analyses of plant life-history variation at the global scale and reveal that demographic trade-offs along multiple axes act to structure local communities.},

	abstract = {{$[$}1. The effect of seasonal water availability on phenology and shoot total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) of three Psychotria species was investigated by irrigating two large plots of mature tropical forest in Panama during the dry season for five consecutive years. This study reports results for the fifth and final year of irrigation. 2. Irrigation did not affect total production of leaves, inflorescences or infructescenes but did advance the timing of leaf production in all Psychotria, and advanced the timing of inflorescence production in P. furcata and P. marginata and infructescence production in P. furcata. Irrigation also reduced shoot TNC levels. 3. Shoot TNC levels in all three species of Psychotria showed similar depressions at the end of the dry season and maximum levels near the end of the wet season. Depletion of shoot TNC occurred just before or during peak leaf production but did not coincide with production of inflorescences or infructescences. Therefore, we hypothesize that shoot TNC supported part of the cost of new leaf production but production of inflorescences and infructescences was most likely supported by current photosynthate. 4. Tropical plants generally show less seasonal variation in TNC than plants from more variable climates but stored carbon still plays an important role in the growth of Psychotria, although its direct role in reproduction appears limited.{$]$}},

	abstract = {Summary Tree internal carbon (C) fluxes between compound and compartment pools are difficult to measure directly. Here we used a C mass balance approach to decipher these fluxes and provide a full description of tree C allocation dynamics. We collected independent measurements of tree C sinks, source and pools in Pinus halepensis in a semi-arid forest, and converted all fluxes to g C per tree d−1. Using this data set, a process flowchart was created to describe and quantify the tree C allocation on diurnal to annual time-scales. The annual C source of 24.5 kg C per tree yr−1 was balanced by C sinks of 23.5 kg C per tree yr−1, which partitioned into 70\%, 17\% and 13\% between respiration, growth, and litter (plus export to soil), respectively. Large imbalances (up to 57 g C per tree d−1) were observed as C excess during the wet season, and as C deficit during the dry season. Concurrent changes in C reserves (starch) were sufficient to buffer these transient C imbalances. The C pool dynamics calculated using the flowchart were in general agreement with the observed pool sizes, providing confidence regarding our estimations of the timing, magnitude, and direction of the internal C fluxes.},

	abstract = {Abstract Radiocarbon signatures (Δ14C) of carbon dioxide (CO2) provide a measure of the age of C being decomposed by microbes or respired by living plants. Over a 2-year period, we measured Δ14C of soil respiration and soil CO2 in boreal forest sites in Canada, which varied primarily in the amount of time since the last stand-replacing fire. Comparing bulk respiration Δ14C with Δ14C of CO2 evolved in incubations of heterotrophic (decomposing organic horizons) and autotrophic (root and moss) components allowed us to estimate the relative contributions of O horizon decomposition vs. plant sources. Although soil respiration fluxes did not vary greatly, differences in Δ14C of respired CO2 indicated marked variation in respiration sources in space and time. The 14C signature of respired CO2 respired from O horizon decomposition depended on the age of C substrates. These varied with time since fire, but consistently had Δ14C greater (averaging ∼120‰) than autotrophic respiration. The Δ14C of autotrophically respired CO2 in young stands equaled those expected for recent photosynthetic products (70‰ in 2003, 64‰ in 2004). CO2 respired by black spruce roots in stands >40 years old had Δ14C up to 30‰ higher than recent photosynthates, indicating a significant contribution of C stored at least several years in plants. Decomposition of O horizon organic matter made up 20\% or less of soil respiration in the younger (<40 years since fire) stands, increasing to ∼50\% in mature stands. This is a minimum for total heterotrophic contribution, since mineral soil CO2 had Δ14C close to or less than those we have assigned to autotrophic respiration. Decomposition of old organic matter in mineral soils clearly contributed to soil respiration in younger stands in 2003, a very dry year, when Δ14C of soil respiration in younger successional stands dropped below those of the atmospheric CO2.},

	abstract = {Abstract Much of our understanding about how carbon (C) is allocated in plants comes from radiocarbon (14C) pulse-chase labeling experiments. However, the large amounts of 14C required for decay-counting mean that these studies have been restricted for the most part to mesocosm or controlled laboratory experiments. Using the enhanced sensitivity for 14C detection available with accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), we tested the utility of a low-level 14C pulse-chase labeling technique for quantifying C allocation patterns and the contributions of different plant components to total ecosystem respiration in a black spruce forest stand in central Manitoba, Canada. All aspects of the field experiment used 14C at levels well below regulated health standards, without significantly altering atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Over 30 days following the label application in late summer (August and September), we monitored the temporal and spatial allocation patterns of labeled photosynthetic products by measuring the amount and 14C content of CO2 respired from different ecosystem components. The mean residence times (MRT) for labeled photosynthetic products to be respired in the understory (feather mosses), canopy (black spruce), and rhizosphere (black spruce roots and associated microbes) were <1, 6, and 15 days, respectively. Respiration from the canopy and understory showed significantly greater influence of labeled photosynthates than excised root and intact rhizosphere respiration. After 30 days,∼65\% of the label assimilated had been respired by the canopy,∼20\% by the rhizosphere, and∼9\% by the understory, with∼6\% unaccounted for and perhaps remaining in tissues. Maximum 14C values in root and rhizosphere respiration were reached 4 days after label application. The label was still detectable in root, rhizosphere and canopy respiration after 30 days; these levels of remaining label would not have been detectible had a 13C label been applied. Our results support previous studies indicating that a substantial portion of the C fueling rhizosphere respiration in the growing season may be derived from stored C pools rather than recent photosynthetic products.},

Distinct labels were found in fine roots (38\%) and sporocarps of mycorrhizal fungi (62\%). Soil particles attached to fine roots contained 9\% new C, whereas no measurable signal was detected in bulk soil. Soil-air CO2 consisted of 35\% new C, indicating that considerable amounts of assimilates were rapidly returned back to the atmosphere. *  These data illustrate a relatively slow dilution of old mobile C pools in trees, but a pronounced allocation of very recent assimilates to C pools of short residence times.},

@article{Felten:2007ug,
	abstract = {With a new approach we assessed the relative contribution of stored and current carbon compounds to new shoot growth in alpine treeline conifers. Within a free air CO2 enrichment experiment at the alpine treeline in Switzerland, 13C-depleted fossil CO2 was used to trace new carbon in the two tree species Larix decidua L. and Pinus uncinata Ramond over two subsequent years. The deciduous L. decidua was found to supply new shoot growth (structural woody part) by 46{\%} from storage. Surprisingly, the evergreen P. uncinata, assumed to use current-year photosynthates, also utilized a considerable fraction of storage (42{\%}) for new wood growth. In contrast, the needles of P. uncinata were built up almost completely from current-year photosynthates. The isotopic composition of different wood carbon fractions revealed a similar relative allocation of current and stored assimilates to various carbon fractions. Elevated CO2 influenced the composition of woody tissue in a species-specific way, e.g. the water soluble fraction decreased in pine in 2001 but increased in larch in 2002 compared to ambient CO2. Heavy defoliation applied as an additional treatment factor in the second year of the experiment decreased the lipophilic fraction in current-year wood in both species compared to undefoliated trees. We conclude that storage may play an important role for new shoot growth in these treeline conifers and that altered carbon availability (elevated CO2, defoliation) results in significant changes in the relative amount of mobile carbon fractions in woody tissue. In particular, stored carbon seems to be of greater importance in the evergreen P. uncinata than has been previously thought.},

	abstract = {Summary We present an intra-annual stable carbon isotope (δ13C) study based on a labeling experiment to illustrate differences in temporal patterns of recent carbon allocation to wood structures of two functional types of trees, Podocarpus falcatus (a late-successional evergreen conifer) and Croton macrostachyus (a deciduous broadleaved pioneer tree), in a tropical mountain forest in Ethiopia. Dendrometer data, wood anatomical thin sections, and intra-annual δ13C analyses were applied. Isotope data revealed a clear annual growth pattern in both studied species. For P. falcatus, it was possible to synchronize annual δ13C peaks, wood anatomical structures and monthly precipitation patterns. The labeling signature was evident for three consecutive years. For C. macrostachyus, isotope data illustrate a rapid decline of the labeling signal within half a year. Our δ13C labeling study indicates a distinct difference in carryover effects between trees of different functional types. A proportion of the labeled δ13C is stored in reserves of wood parenchyma for up to 3 yr in P. falcatus. By contrast, C. macrostachyus shows a high turnover of assimilates and a carbon carryover effect is only detectable in the subsequent year.},

@article{carlquist_living_2018,
	abstract = {The very different evolutionary pathways of conifers and angiosperms are very informative precisely because their wood anatomy is so different. New information from anatomy, comparative wood physiology, and comparative ultrastructure can be combined to provide evidence for the role of axial and ray parenchyma in the two groups. Gnetales, which are essentially conifers with vessels, have evolved parallel to angiosperms and show us the value of multiseriate rays and axial parenchyma in a vessel-bearing wood. Gnetales also force us to re-examine optimum anatomical solutions to conduction in vesselless gymnosperms. Axial parenchyma in vessel-bearing woods has diversified to take prominent roles in storage of water and carbohydrates as well as maintenance of conduction in vessels. Axial parenchyma, along with other modifications, has superseded scalariform perforation plates as a safety mechanism and permitted angiosperms to succeed in more seasonal habitats. This diversification has required connection to rays, which have concomitantly become larger and more diverse, acting as pathways for photosynthate passage and storage. Modes of growth such as rapid flushing, vernal leafing-out, drought deciduousness and support of large leaf surfaces become possible, advantaging angiosperms over conifers in various ways. Prominent tracheid-ray pitting (conifers) and axial parenchyma/ray pitting to vessels (angiosperms) are evidence of release of photosynthates into conductive cells; in angiosperms, this system has permitted vessels to survive hydrologic stresses and function in more seasonal habitats. Flow in ray and axial parenchyma cells, suggested by greater length/width ratios of component cells, is confirmed by pitting on end walls of elongate cells: pits are greater in area, more densely placed, and are often bordered. Bordered pit areas and densities on living cells, like those on tracheids and vessels, represent maximal contact areas between cells while minimizing loss of wall strength. Storage cells in rays can be distinguished from flow cells by size and shape, by fewer and smaller pits and by contents. By lacking secondary walls, the entire surfaces of phloem ray and axial phloem parenchyma become conducting areas across which sugars can be translocated. The intercontinuous network of axial parenchyma and ray parenchyma in woods is confirmed; there are no ``isolated'' living cells in wood when three-dimensional studies are made. Water storage in living cells is reported anatomically and also in the form of percentile quantitative data which reveal degrees and kinds of succulence in angiosperm woods, and norms for ``typically woody'' species. The diversity in angiosperm axial and ray parenchyma is presented as a series of probable optimal solutions to diverse types of ecology, growth form, and physiology. The numerous homoplasies in these anatomical modes are seen as the informative results of natural experiments and should be considered as evidence along with experimental evidence. Elliptical shape of rays seems governed by mechanical considerations; unusually long (vertically) rays represent a tradeoff in favor of flexibility versus strength. Protracted juvenilism (paedomorphosis) features redirection of flow from horizontal to vertical by means of rays composed predominantly or wholly of upright cells, and the reasons for this anatomical strategy are sought. Protracted juvenilism, still little appreciated, occurs in a sizeable proportion of the world's plants and is a major source of angiosperm diversification.},

@article{genet:2009,
	abstract = {{Two types of physiological mechanisms can contribute to growth decline with age: (i) the mechanisms leading to the reduction of carbon assimilation (input) and (ii) those leading to modification of the resource economy. Surprisingly, the processes relating to carbon allocation have been little investigated as compared to research on the processes governing carbon assimilation. The objective of this paper was thus to test the hypothesis that growth decrease related to age is accompanied by changes in carbon allocation to the benefit of storage and reproductive functions in two contrasting broad-leaved species: beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). Age-related changes in carbon allocation were studied using a chronosequence approach. Chronosequences, each consisting of several even-aged stands ranging from 14 to 175 years old for beech and from 30 to 134 years old for sessile oak, were divided into five or six age classes. In this study, carbon allocations to growth, storage and reproduction were defined as the relative amount of carbon invested in biomass increment, carbohydrate increment and seed production, respectively. Tree-ring width and allometric relationships were used to assess biomass increment at the tree and stand scales. Below-ground biomass was assessed using a specific allometric relationship between root:shoot ratio and age, established from the literature review. Seasonal variations of carbohydrate concentrations were used to assess carbon allocation to storage. Reproduction effort was quantified for beech stands by collecting seed and cupule production. Age-related flagging of biomass productivity was assessed at the tree and stand scales, and carbohydrate quantities in trees increased with age for both species. Seed and cupule production increased with stand age in beech from 56 gC m−2 year−1 at 30 years old to 129 gC m−2 year−1 at 138 years old. In beech, carbon allocation to storage and reproductive functions increased with age to the detriment of carbon allocation to growth functions. In contrast, the carbon balance between growth and storage remained constant between age classes in sessile oak. The contrasting age-related changes in carbon allocation between beech and sessile oak are discussed with reference to the differences in growing environment, phenology and hydraulic properties of ring-porous and diffuse-porous species.}},

The analysis was conducted to obtain more detailed information on seasonal fluctuation of these components and of the tree-to-tree variation and within stem variation. The sugars were analysed by GLC-MS. The smallest total soluble sugar amounts (consisting of sucrose, fructose, glucose, raffinose and myo-inositol) in young trees were measured during mid-summer (ca. 0.3{\%}) and the largest while in dormancy (ca. 1.6{\%} on wood dry weight basis). Raffinose was detected in autumn as a minor component. The proportion of monosaccharides and the amount of myo-inositol were largest during growth. Compared to other studies silver birch showed more evident seasonal fluctuation in soluble sugars than evergreen tree species. The sugar amount in mature stems was approximately at the same level as in young trees that had the same felling time. Tree-to-tree variation in the non-structural carbohydrates in the mature wood was fairly large. However, the amount of total soluble sugars, sucrose and glucose showed significant variation within the stem. The amount of these sugars was largest in samples that were taken close to the cambium. Starch was also detected close to pith. According to the heartwood definition and starch measurement results in this paper, it could be stated that silver birch does not form heartwood.},

@article{smith:2017,
	abstract = {{Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) form a fundamental yet poorly quantified carbon pool in trees. Studies of NSC seasonality in forest trees have seldom measured whole-tree NSC stocks and allocation among organs, and are not representative of all tree functional types. Non-structural carbohydrate research has primarily focussed on broadleaf deciduous and coniferous evergreen trees with distinct growing seasons, while broadleaf evergreen trees remain under-studied despite their different growth phenology. We measured whole-tree NSC allocation and temporal variation in Eucalyptus obliqua L'H{\'e}r., a broadleaf evergreen tree species typically occurring in mixed-age temperate forests, which has year-round growth and the capacity to resprout after fire. Our overarching objective was to improve the empirical basis for understanding the functional importance of NSC allocation and stock changes at the tree- and organ-level in this tree functional type. Starch was the principal storage carbohydrate and was primarily stored in the stem and roots of young (14-year-old) trees rather than the lignotuber, which did not appear to be a specialized starch storage organ. Whole-tree NSC stocks were depleted during spring and summer due to significant decreases in starch mass in the roots and stem, seemingly to support root and crown growth but potentially exacerbated by water stress in summer. Seasonality of stem NSCs differed between young and mature trees, and was not synchronized with stem basal area increments in mature trees. Our results suggest that the relative magnitude of seasonal NSC stock changes could vary with tree growth stage, and that the main drivers of NSC fluctuations in broadleaf evergreen trees in temperate biomes could be periodic disturbances such as summer drought and fire, rather than growth phenology. These results have implications for understanding post-fire tree recovery via resprouting, and for incorporating NSC pools into carbon models of mixed-age forests.}},

The xylem also functions for a limited time. In ring-porous trees water conduction takes place primarily in the youngest growth ring; most vessels of older growth rings are embolized and in some species, such as Robinia pseudoacacia L., filled with tyloses. On the other hand, phloem and xylem parenchyma cells, which function as storage tissue, remain alive and functional for many years. Most of these cells are therefore not in direct contact with functional sieve elements and vessels.

	abstract = {The seasonal pattern in starch, various sugars, protein, and fat, and their interrelationship, has been followed in 3-year-old branch wood of poplar trees (Populus x canadensis Moench `robusta') under natural site conditions. The deposition of starch, protein and fat proceeds at different times. Starch accumulates from May until October, fat mainly during the summer months, and protein when the leaves are yellowing in September and October. The maximum concentrations in the branch wood were 15--18 μg starch, 6--9 μg protein, 4--8 μg fat, 10--15 μg sucrose, and up to 30 μg total sugars per milligram dry weight (DW). During starch deposition periods no increased sucrose level is found in the tissue. The maximum daily starch deposition rate was 0.2--0.4 μg starch/day/mg DW of wood. During starch hydrolysis in late autumn and winter, a dramatic increase in sucrose and its galactosides is measured (up to 15--27 μg/mg DW in total). In early spring, before budbreak, the concentrations of these sugars diminishes sharply. In contrast to this clear-cut starch-to-sugar conversion in autumn no significant starch-to-fat conversion is detected. An elevated content of free glycerol, however, is found in winter. In spring, starch and storage protein are mobilized completely, or almost completely, in poplar twig wood. A noteworthy pool of maltose is found transiently during autumn (up to 8 μg/mg DW) and again in spring. The results demonstrate that the individual storage materials, e.g. starch, protein, and fat, are accumulated fairly independently in the wood storage parenchyma. Tissue sugar levels, in contrast, appear to be closely related to the seasonal variations in starch content, on the one hand, and to the acclimation and deacclimation of the cells, on the other. The interrelations of the storage materials and sugars are discussed.},

@article{Galian:2017,
	abstract = {Abstract Carbon reserves are important for maintaining tree function during and after stress. Increasing tree mortality driven by drought globally has renewed the interest in how plants regulate allocation of recently fixed C to reserve formation. Three-year-old seedlings of two species (Tilia platyphyllos and Pinus sylvestris) were exposed to two intensities of experimental drought during ~10 weeks, and 13C pulse labelling was subsequently applied with rewetting. Tracking the 13C label across different organs and C compounds (soluble sugars, starch, myo-inositol, lipids and cellulose), together with the monitoring of gas exchange and C mass balances over time, allowed for the identification of variations in C allocation priorities and tree C balances that are associated with drought effects and subsequent drought release. The results demonstrate that soluble sugars accumulated in P. sylvestris under drought conditions independently of growth trends; thus, non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) formation cannot be simply considered a passive overflow process in this species. Once drought ceased, C allocation to storage was still prioritized at the expense of growth, which suggested the presence of `drought memory effects', possibly to ensure future growth and survival. On the contrary, NSC and growth dynamics in T. platyphyllos were consistent with a passive (overflow) view of NSC formation.},

	abstract = {Summary Carbon allocation to growth, storage, reproduction and the effects of stress and disturbances on these processes remain poorly understood in trees. Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) are an important component of the carbon storage pool and are commonly used to assess whether tree growth under various conditions is carbon limited. Carbon limitation is generally assumed to result in reduced NSC levels and allocation, but changes in allocation priorities that favour NSC storage could also limit carbon available for growth. We defoliated six mature oak trees in June 2010 and explored how defoliation affects the relationship between radial growth and net NSC storage, estimated by the seasonal increase in NSC concentration, for several years. We interpret our results in the context of a conceptual model of allocation -- developed here -- to help understand how allocation changed following defoliation. We also monitored flower and acorn production in 2011, as changes in reproduction could also affect allocation to growth and storage. Defoliation reduced radial growth for 3 years. Stemwood starch levels and storage were also generally reduced, although not as consistently as growth. In contrast, root collar NSC storage was significantly greater in defoliated trees, allowing below-ground stores to recover to control levels by November 2011. Defoliation had mixed effects on reproduction in 2011: production of second-year acorns (initiated before defoliation) was not significantly affected, but there was complete cessation of flower production. Defoliation also changed the relationship between NSC allocation and growth in the 2 years following defoliation, indicating a shift in allocation favouring storage. According to our conceptual model, the positive relationship between growth and NSC allocation indicates that the allocation shifts occurred under carbon-limiting conditions. We, therefore, propose that growth can be carbon limited by two different means: (i) a decrease in plant carbon availability and (ii) allocation shifts that reduce the priority of growth relative to other processes such as storage. Prioritizing storage over both growth and reproduction may be a strategy to protect against further disturbance or stress following storage depletion. Synthesis. Recovery following defoliation can involve substantial shifts in how trees allocate carbon between different functions, with carbohydrate storage and already initiated reproduction cycles being favoured relative to growth and new reproductive cycles.},

	abstract = {The xylem is a complex system that includes a network of dead conduits ensuring long-distance water transport in plants. Under ongoing climate changes, xylem embolism is a major and recurrent cause of drought-induced tree mortality. Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) play key roles in plant responses to drought and frost stress, and several studies putatively suggest their involvement in the regulation of xylem water transport. However, a clear picture on the roles of NSCs in plant hydraulics has not been drawn to date. We summarize the current knowledge on the involvement of NSCs during embolism formation and subsequent hydraulic recovery. Under drought, sugars are generally accumulated in xylem parenchyma and in xylem sap. At drought-relief, xylem functionality is putatively restored in an osmotically driven process involving wood parenchyma, xylem sap and phloem compartments. By analyzing the published data on stem hydraulics and NSC contents under drought/frost stress and subsequent stress relief, we found that embolism build-up positively correlated to stem NSC depletion, and that the magnitude of post-stress hydraulic recovery positively correlated to consumption of soluble sugars. These findings suggest a close relationship between hydraulics and carbohydrate dynamics. We call for more experiments on hydraulic and NSC dynamics in controlled and field conditions.},

@article{Hummel357,
	abstract = {Growth and carbon (C) fluxes are severely altered in plants exposed to soil water deficit. Correspondingly, it has been suggested that plants under water deficit suffer from C shortage. In this study, we test this hypothesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) by providing an overview of the responses of growth, C balance, metabolites, enzymes of the central metabolism, and a set of sugar-responsive genes to a sustained soil water deficit. The results show that under drought, rosette relative expansion rate is decreased more than photosynthesis, leading to a more positive C balance, while root growth is promoted. Several soluble metabolites accumulate in response to soil water deficit, with K+ and organic acids as the main contributors to osmotic adjustment. Osmotic adjustment costs only a small percentage of the daily photosynthetic C fixation. All C metabolites measured (not only starch and sugars but also organic acids and amino acids) show a diurnal turnover that often increased under water deficit, suggesting that these metabolites are readily available for being metabolized in situ or exported to roots. On the basis of 30 enzyme activities, no in-depth reprogramming of C metabolism was observed. Water deficit induces a shift of the expression level of a set of sugar-responsive genes that is indicative of increased, rather than decreased, C availability. These results converge to show that the differential impact of soil water deficit on photosynthesis and rosette expansion results in an increased availability of C for the roots, an increased turnover of C metabolites, and a low-cost C-based osmotic adjustment, and these responses are performed without major reformatting of the primary metabolism machinery.},

@article{Kozlowski:1992vn,
	abstract = {Each perennial woody plant is a highly integrated system of competing carbohydrate sinks (utilization sites). Internal competition for carbohydrates is shown by changes in rates of carbohydrate movement from sources to sinks and reversals in direction of carbohydrate transport as the relative sink strengths of various organs change. Most carbohydrates are produced in foliage leaves but some are synthesized in cotyledons, hypocotyls, buds, twigs, stems, flowers, fruits, and strobili. Although the bulk of the carbohydrate pool moves to sinks through the phloem, some carbohydrates are obtained by sinks from the xylem sap. Sugars are actively accumulated in the phloem and move passively to sinks along a concentration gradient. The dry weight of a mature woody plant represents only a small proportion of the photosynthate it produced. This discrepancy results not only from consumption of plant tissues by herbivores and shedding of plant parts, but also from depletion of carbohydrates by respiration, leaching, exudation, secretion, translocation to other plants through root grafts and mycorrhizae and losses to parasites. Large spatial and temporal variations occur in the use of reserve- and currently produced carbohydrates in metabolism and growth of shoots, stems, roots, and reproductive structures. A portion of the carbohydrate pool is diverted for production of chemicals involved in defense against fungi, herbivores, and competing plants. Woody plants accumulate carbohydrates during periods of excess production and deplete carbohydrates when the rate of utilization exceeds the rate of production. Stored carbohydrates play an important role in metabolism, growth, defense, cold hardiness, and postponement or prevention of plant mortality.},

	abstract = {Summary Carbon (C) allocation plays a central role in tree responses to environmental changes. Yet, fundamental questions remain about how trees allocate C to different sinks, for example, growth vs storage and defense. In order to elucidate allocation priorities, we manipulated the whole-tree C balance by modifying atmospheric CO2 concentrations [CO2] to create two distinct gradients of declining C availability, and compared how C was allocated among fluxes (respiration and volatile monoterpenes) and biomass C pools (total biomass, nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) and secondary metabolites (SM)) in well-watered Norway spruce (Picea abies) saplings. Continuous isotope labelling was used to trace the fate of newly-assimilated C. Reducing [CO2] to 120 ppm caused an aboveground C compensation point (i.e. net C balance was zero) and resulted in decreases in growth and respiration. By contrast, soluble sugars and SM remained relatively constant in aboveground young organs and were partially maintained with a constant allocation of newly-assimilated C, even at expense of root death from C exhaustion. We conclude that spruce trees have a conservative allocation strategy under source limitation: growth and respiration can be downregulated to maintain `operational' concentrations of NSC while investing newly-assimilated C into future survival by producing SM.},

@article{martinez-vilalt:2016,
	abstract = {Abstract Plants store large amounts of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). While multiple functions of NSC have long been recognized, the interpretation of NSC seasonal dynamics is often based on the idea that stored NSC is a reservoir of carbon that fluctuates depending on the balance between supply via photosynthesis and demand for growth and respiration (the source--sink dynamics concept). Consequently, relatively high NSC concentrations in some plants have been interpreted to reflect excess supply relative to demand. An alternative view, however, is that NSC accumulation reflects the relatively high NSC levels required for plant survival; an important issue that remains highly controversial. Here, we assembled a new global database to examine broad patterns of seasonal NSC variation across organs (leaves, stems, and belowground), plant functional types (coniferous, drought-deciduous angiosperms, winter deciduous angiosperms, evergreen angiosperms, and herbaceous) and biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and tropical). We compiled data from 121 studies, including seasonal measurements for 177 species under natural conditions. Our results showed that, on average, NSC account for ~10\% of dry plant biomass and are highest in leaves and lowest in stems, whereas belowground organs show intermediate concentrations. Total NSC, starch, and soluble sugars (SS) varied seasonally, with a strong depletion of starch during the growing season and a general increase during winter months, particularly in boreal and temperate biomes. Across functional types, NSC concentrations were highest and most variable in herbaceous species and in conifer needles. Conifers showed the lowest stem and belowground NSC concentrations. Minimum NSC values were relatively high (46\% of seasonal maximums on average for total NSC) and, in contrast to average values, were similar among biomes and functional types. Overall, although starch depletion was relatively common, seasonal depletion of total NSC or SS was rare. These results are consistent with a dual view of NSC function: whereas starch acts mostly as a reservoir for future use, soluble sugars perform immediate functions (e.g., osmoregulation) and are kept above some critical threshold. If confirmed, this dual function of NSC will have important implications for the way we understand and model plant carbon allocation and survival under stress.},

	abstract = {Summary Plant survival during drought requires adequate hydration in living tissues and carbohydrate reserves for maintenance and recovery. We hypothesized that tree growth and hydraulic strategy determines the intensity and duration of the `physiological drought', thereby affecting the relative contributions of loss of hydraulic function and carbohydrate depletion during mortality. We compared patterns in growth rate, water relations, gas exchange and carbohydrate dynamics in three tree species subjected to prolonged drought. Two Eucalyptus species (E. globulus, E. smithii) exhibited high growth rates and water-use resulting in rapid declines in water status and hydraulic conductance. In contrast, conservative growth and water relations in Pinus radiata resulted in longer periods of negative carbon balance and significant depletion of stored carbohydrates in all organs. The ongoing demand for carbohydrates from sustained respiration highlighted the role that duration of drought plays in facilitating carbohydrate consumption. Two drought strategies were revealed, differentiated by plant regulation of water status: plants maximized gas exchange, but were exposed to low water potentials and rapid hydraulic dysfunction; and tight regulation of gas exchange at the cost of carbohydrate depletion. These findings provide evidence for a relationship between hydraulic regulation of water status and carbohydrate depletion during terminal drought.},

	abstract = {Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) are plant storage compounds used for metabolism, transport, osmoregulation and regrowth following the loss of plant tissue. Even in conditions suitable for optimal growth, plants continue to store NSCs. This storage may be due to passive accumulation from sink-inhibited growth or active reserves that come at the expense of growth. The former pathway implies that NSCs may be a by-product of sink limitation, while the latter suggests a functional role of NSCs for use during poor conditions.Using 13C pulse labelling, we traced the source of soluble sugars in stem and root organs during drought and everwet conditions for seedlings of two tropical tree species that differ in drought tolerance to estimate the relative allocation of NSCs stored prior to drought versus NSCs assimilated during drought. We monitored growth, stomatal conductance, stem water potential and NSC storage to assess a broad carbon response to drought.We found that the drought-sensitive species had reduced growth, conserved NSC concentrations in leaf, stem and root organs and had a larger proportion of soluble sugars in stem and root organs that originated from pre-drought storage relative to seedlings in control conditions. In contrast, the drought-tolerant species maintained growth and stem and root NSC concentrations but had reduced leaf NSCs concentrations with a larger proportion of stem and root soluble sugars originated from freshly assimilated photosynthates relative to control seedlings. These results suggest the drought-sensitive species passively accumulated NSCs during water deficit due to growth inhibition, while the drought-tolerant species actively responded to water deficit by allocating NSCs to stem and root organs. These strategies seem correlated with baseline maximum growth rates, which supports previous research suggesting a trade-off between growth and drought tolerance while providing new evidence for the importance of plasticity in NSC allocation during drought.},

	abstract = {One major effect of global climate change will be altered precipitation patterns in many regions of the world. This will cause a higher probability of long-term waterlogging in winter/spring and flash floods in summer because of extreme rainfall events. Particularly, trees not adapted at their natural site to such waterlogging stress can be impaired. Despite the enormous economic, ecological and social importance of forest ecosystems, the effect of waterlogging on trees is far less understood than the effect on many crops or the model plant Arabidopsis. There is only a handful of studies available investigating the transcriptome and metabolome of waterlogged trees. Main physiological responses of trees to waterlogging include the stimulation of fermentative pathways and an accelerated glycolytic flux. Many energy-consuming, anabolic processes are slowed down to overcome the energy crisis mediated by waterlogging. A crucial feature of waterlogging tolerance is the steady supply of glycolysis with carbohydrates, particularly in the roots; stress-sensitive trees fail to maintain sufficient carbohydrate availability resulting in the dieback of the stressed tissues. The present review summarizes physiological and molecular features of waterlogging tolerance of trees; the focus is on carbon metabolism in both, leaves and roots of trees.},

The expected climate feedbacks of regional-scale mortality events have intensified the need to improve the simple mortality algorithms used for future predictions, but uncertainty regarding mortality processes precludes mechanistic modeling. By integrating new evidence from a wide range of fields, we conclude that hydraulic function and carbohydrate and defense metabolism have numerous potential failure points, and that these processes are strongly interdependent, both with each other and with destructive pathogen and insect populations. Crucially, most of these mechanisms and their interdependencies are likely to become amplified under a warmer, drier climate. Here, we outline the observations and experiments needed to test this interdependence and to improve simulations of this emergent global phenomenon.},

Terrestrial ecosystems and, in particular, forests exert strong controls on the global carbon cycle and influence regional hydrology and climatology directly through water and surface energy budgets [Bonan, 2008; Chapin et al., 2008]. According to new research, tree mortality associated with elevated temperatures and drought has the potential to rapidly alter forest ecosystems, potentially affecting feedbacks to the Earth system [Allen et al., 2010]. Several lines of recent research demonstrate how tree mortality rates in forests may be sensitive to climate change---particularly warming and drying.

It remains uncertain, however, whether tree mortality across drought-stricken landscapes will be concentrated in particular climatic and competitive environments. We investigated the effects of long-term average climate [i.e. 35-year mean annual climatic water deficit (CWD)] and competition (i.e. tree basal area) on tree mortality patterns, using extensive aerial mortality surveys conducted throughout the forests of California during a 4-year statewide extreme drought lasting from 2012 to 2015. During this period, tree mortality increased by an order of magnitude, typically from tens to hundreds of dead trees per km2, rising dramatically during the fourth year of drought. Mortality rates increased independently with average CWD and with basal area, and they increased disproportionately in areas that were both dry and dense. These results can assist forest managers and policy-makers in identifying the most drought-vulnerable forests across broad geographic areas.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, and/or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could fundamentally alter the composition, structure, and biogeography of forests in many regions. Of particular concern are potential increases in tree mortality associated with climate-induced physiological stress and interactions with other climate-mediated processes such as insect outbreaks and wildfire. Despite this risk, existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms, and there has been no attempt to track observations of climate-driven tree mortality globally. Here we present the first global assessment of recent tree mortality attributed to drought and heat stress. Although episodic mortality occurs in the absence of climate change, studies compiled here suggest that at least some of the world's forested ecosystems already may be responding to climate change and raise concern that forests may become increasingly vulnerable to higher background tree mortality rates and die-off in response to future warming and drought, even in environments that are not normally considered water-limited. This further suggests risks to ecosystem services, including the loss of sequestered forest carbon and associated atmospheric feedbacks. Our review also identifies key information gaps and scientific uncertainties that currently hinder our ability to predict tree mortality in response to climate change and emphasizes the need for a globally coordinated observation system. Overall, our review reveals the potential for amplified tree mortality due to drought and heat in forests worldwide.},

	abstract = {We show that the water savings that plants experience under high CO2 conditions compensate for much of the effect of warmer temperatures, keeping the amount of water on land, on average, higher than we would predict with common drought metrics, and with a different spatial pattern. The implications of plants needing less water under high CO2 reaches beyond drought prediction to the assessment of climate change impacts on agriculture, water resources, wildfire risk, and vegetation dynamics.Rising atmospheric CO2 will make Earth warmer, and many studies have inferred that this warming will cause droughts to become more widespread and severe. However, rising atmospheric CO2 also modifies stomatal conductance and plant water use, processes that are often are overlooked in impact analysis. We find that plant physiological responses to CO2 reduce predictions of future drought stress, and that this reduction is captured by using plant-centric rather than atmosphere-centric metrics from Earth system models (ESMs). The atmosphere-centric Palmer Drought Severity Index predicts future increases in drought stress for more than 70\% of global land area. This area drops to 37\% with the use of precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-E), a measure that represents the water flux available to downstream ecosystems and humans. The two metrics yield consistent estimates of increasing stress in regions where precipitation decreases are more robust (southern North America, northeastern South America, and southern Europe). The metrics produce diverging estimates elsewhere, with P-E predicting decreasing stress across temperate Asia and central Africa. The differing sensitivity of drought metrics to radiative and physiological aspects of increasing CO2 partly explains the divergent estimates of future drought reported in recent studies. Further, use of ESM output in offline models may double-count plant feedbacks on relative humidity and other surface variables, leading to overestimates of future stress. The use of drought metrics that account for the response of plant transpiration to changing CO2, including direct use of P-E and soil moisture from ESMs, is needed to reduce uncertainties in future assessment.},

Using output from a suite of general circulation model (GCM) simulations from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, projected twenty-first century drying and wetting trends are investigated using two offline indices of surface moisture balance: the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). PDSI and SPEI projections using precipitation and Penman-Monteith based PET changes from the GCMs generally agree, showing robust cross-model drying in western North America, Central America, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and the Amazon and robust wetting occurring in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes and east Africa (PDSI only). The SPEI is more sensitive to PET changes than the PDSI, especially in arid regions such as the Sahara and Middle East. Regional drying and wetting patterns largely mirror the spatially heterogeneous response of precipitation in the models, although drying in the PDSI and SPEI calculations extends beyond the regions of reduced precipitation. This expansion of drying areas is attributed to globally widespread increases in PET, caused by increases in surface net radiation and the vapor pressure deficit. Increased PET not only intensifies drying in areas where precipitation is already reduced, it also drives areas into drought that would otherwise experience little drying or even wetting from precipitation trends alone. This PET amplification effect is largest in the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, and is especially pronounced in western North America, Europe, and southeast China. Compared to PDSI projections using precipitation changes only, the projections incorporating both precipitation and PET changes increase the percentage of global land area projected to experience at least moderate drying (PDSI standard deviation of ≤−1) by the end of the twenty-first century from 12 to 30 {\%}. PET induced moderate drying is even more severe in the SPEI projections (SPEI standard deviation of ≤−1; 11 to 44 {\%}), although this is likely less meaningful because much of the PET induced drying in the SPEI occurs in the aforementioned arid regions. Integrated accounting of both the supply and demand sides of the surface moisture balance is therefore critical for characterizing the full range of projected drought risks tied to increasing greenhouse gases and associated warming of the climate system.},

	abstract = {Summary Drought-induced tree mortality has major impacts on ecosystem carbon and water cycles, and is expected to increase in forests across the globe with climate change. A large body of research in the past decade has advanced our understanding of plant water and carbon relations under drought. However, despite intense research, we still lack generalizable, cross-scale indicators of mortality risk. In this Viewpoint, we propose that a more explicit consideration of water pools could improve our ability to monitor and anticipate mortality risk. Specifically, we focus on the relative water content (RWC), a classic metric in plant water relations, as a potential indicator of mortality risk that is physiologically relevant and integrates different aspects related to hydraulics, stomatal responses and carbon economy under drought. Measures of plant water content are likely to have a strong mechanistic link with mortality and to be integrative, threshold-prone and relatively easy to measure and monitor at large spatial scales, and may complement current mortality metrics based on water potential, loss of hydraulic conductivity and nonstructural carbohydrates. We discuss some of the potential advantages and limitations of these metrics to improve our capacity to monitor and predict drought-induced tree mortality.},

	abstract = { Tropical woody plants store ∼230 petagrams of carbon (PgC) in their aboveground living biomass. This review suggests that these stocks are currently growing in primary forests at rates that have decreased in recent decades. Droughts are an important mechanism in reducing forest C uptake and stocks by decreasing photosynthesis, elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires. Tropical forests were a C source to the atmosphere during the 2015--2016 El Ni{\~n}o--related drought, with some estimates suggesting that up to 2.3 PgC were released. With continued climate change, the intensity and frequency of droughts and fires will likely increase. It is unclear at what point the impacts of severe, repeated disturbances by drought and fires could exceed tropical forests' capacity to recover. Although specific threshold conditions beyond which ecosystem properties could lead to alternative stable states are largely unknown, the growing body of scientific evidence points to such threshold conditions becoming more likely as climate and land use change across the tropics. ▪ Droughts have reduced forest carbon uptake and stocks by elevating tree mortality, increasing autotrophic respiration, and promoting wildfires. ▪ Threshold conditions beyond which tropical forests are pushed into alternative stable states are becoming more likely as effects of droughts intensify. },

	abstract = {Abstract The increasing strength of land CO2 uptake in the 2000s has been attributed to a stimulating effect of rising atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis (CO2 fertilization). Using terrestrial biosphere models, we show that enhanced CO2 uptake is induced not only by CO2 fertilization but also an increasing uptake by plant regrowth (accounting for 0.33 $\pm$ 0.10 Pg C/year increase of CO2 uptake in the 2000s compared with the 1960s--1990s) with its effect most pronounced in eastern North America, southern-eastern Europe, and southeastern temperate Eurasia. Our analysis indicates that ecosystems in North America and Europe have established the current productive state through regrowth since the 1960s, and those in temperate Eurasia are still in a stage from regrowth following active afforestation in the 1980s--1990s. As the strength of model representation of CO2 fertilization is still in debate, plant regrowth might have a greater potential to sequester carbon than indicated by this study.},

	abstract = { Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. We review the environmental factors controlling their structure and global distribution and evaluate their current and future trajectory. Adaptations of trees to climate and resource gradients, coupled with disturbances and forest dynamics, create complex geographical patterns in forest assemblages and structures. These patterns are increasingly discernible through new satellite and airborne observation systems, improved forest inventories, and global ecosystem models. Forest biomass is a complex property affected by forest distribution, structure, and ecological processes. Since at least 1990, biomass density has consistently increased in global established forests, despite increasing mortality in some regions, suggesting that a global driver such as elevated CO2 may be enhancing biomass gains. Global forests have also apparently become more dynamic. Advanced information about the structure, distribution, and biomass of the world's forests provides critical ecological insights and opportunities for sustainable forest management and enhancing forest conservation and ecosystem services. },

Upon requirement storage lipids are mobilized from this compartment by triacylglycerol lipases and steryl ester hydrolases. The respective degradation products serve as energy sources and/or building blocks for membrane formation. In this chapter the reader is introduced to different mechanisms of triacylglycerol- and steryl ester synthesis, storage of these lipids in lipid particles and their subsequent mobilization.

Grasses respired 71 and 64\% and shrubs respired 22 and 17\% of the label below-ground in the early and late growing seasons, respectively. Across seasons and plant types, ~48--61\% of the label recovered was respired in 24 h, ~68--84\% in 6 d, and ~16--33\% in 6--36 d after labeling. *  Three C pools were identified for plant metabolism: a fast pool with mean residence times (MRTs) of ~0.5 and ~1 d below- and above-ground, respectively; an intermediate pool with MRTs of 19.9 and 18.9 d; and a storage pool detected in new leaf early growing season respiration > 9 months after assimilation. Differences in allocation to fast vs intermediate C pools resulted in the mean age of C respired by shrubs being shorter (3.8--4.5 d) than that of the grasses (4.8--8.2 d).},

	abstract = {In order to investigate how reliably the carbon 14 content of tree rings reflects that of atmospheric carbon dioxide, two types of determinations were carried out: (1) carbon 14 determinations in annual rings from the beginning of this century until 1974 and (2) carbon 14 determinations in synchronous wood from the North American bristlecone pine and from European oak trees, dendrochronologically dated to have grown in the third and fourth century B.C. The first series of measurements showed that bomb-produced radiocarbon was incorporated in wood at a time when it was converted from sapwood to heartwood, whenever radiocarbon from bomb testing was present in the atmosphere. The second series showed that wood more than 2000 years old and grown on two different continents at different altitudes had, within the limits of experimental error, the same radiocarbon content. This work and other experimental evidence, obtained in part by other laboratories, show that tree rings reflect the average radiocarbon content of global atmospheric carbon dioxide accurately within several per mil. In rare cases, deviations of up to 10‰ may be possible. This means that a typical single radiocarbon date for wood or charcoal possesses an intrinsic uncertainty (viz., an estimated One-sigma error' in addition to all the other errors) of the order of $\pm$50 years. This intrinsic uncertainty is independent of the absolute age of the sample. More accurate dates can, in principle, be obtained by the so-called method of `wiggle matching.'},

	abstract = {Summary While trees store substantial amounts of nonstructural carbon (NSC) for later use, storage regulation and mobilization of stored NSC in long-lived organisms like trees are still not well understood. At two different sites with sugar maple (Acer saccharum), we investigated ascending sap (sugar concentration, δ13C, Δ14C) as the mobilized component of stored stem NSC during early springtime. Using the bomb-spike radiocarbon approach we were able to estimate the average time elapsed since the mobilized carbon (C) was originally fixed from the atmosphere and to infer the turnover time of stem storage. Sites differed in concentration dynamics and overall δ13C, indicating different growing conditions. The absence of temporal trends for δ13C and Δ14C indicated sugar mobilization from a well-mixed pool with average Δ14C consistent with a mean turnover time (TT) of three to five years for this pool, with only minor differences between the sites. Sugar maple trees hence appear well buffered against single or even several years of negative plant C balance from environmental stress such as drought or repeated defoliation by insects. Manipulative investigations (e.g. starvation via girdling) combined with Δ14C measurements of this mobilized storage pool will provide further new insights into tree storage regulation and functioning.},

	abstract = {{Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) are critical to maintain plant metabolism under stressful environmental conditions, but we do not fully understand how NSC allocation and utilization from storage varies with stress. While it has become established that storage allocation is unlikely to be a mere overflow process, very little empirical evidence has been produced to support this view, at least not for trees. Here we present the results of an intensively monitored experimental manipulation of whole-tree carbon (C) balance (young Picea abies (L.) H Karst.) using reduced atmospheric [CO2] and drought to reduce C sources. We measured specific C storage pools (glucose, fructose, sucrose, starch) over 21 weeks and converted concentration measurement into fluxes into and out of the storage pool. Continuous labeling (13C) allowed us to track C allocation to biomass and non-structural C pools. Net C fluxes into the storage pool occurred mainly when the C balance was positive. Storage pools increased during periods of positive C gain and were reduced under negative C gain. 13C data showed that C was allocated to storage pools independent of the net flux and even under severe C limitation. Allocation to below-ground tissues was strongest in control trees followed by trees experiencing drought followed by those grown under low [CO2]. Our data suggest that NSC storage has, under the conditions of our experimental manipulation (e.g., strong progressive drought, no above-ground growth), a high allocation priority and cannot be considered an overflow process. While these results also suggest active storage allocation, definitive proof of active plant control of storage in woody plants requires studies involving molecular tools.}},

	abstract = {The carbon charging of pines across the treeline ecotone of three different climatic zones (Mexico 19$\,^{\circ}$N Pinus hartwegii, Swiss Alps 46$\,^{\circ}$N P. cembra and northern Sweden 68$\,^{\circ}$N P. sylvestris) was analyzed, to test whether a low-temperature-driven carbon shortage can explain high-elevation tree limits, and whether the length of the growing season affects the trees' carbon balance. We quantified the concentrations of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) and lipids (acylglycerols) in all tree organs at three dates during the growing seasons across elevational transects from the upper end of the closed, tall forest (timberline) to the uppermost location where groups of trees ≥3 m in height occur (treeline). Mean ground temperatures during the growing season at the treelines were similar (6.1$\pm$0.7$\,^{\circ}$C) irrespective of latitude. Across the individual transects, the concentrations of NSC and lipids increased with elevation in all organs. By the end of the growing season, all three species had very similar total mobile carbon (TMC) concentrations at the treeline (ca. 6{\%} TMC in the aboveground dry biomass), suggesting no influence of the length of the growing season on tree carbon charging. At a temperate lowland reference site P. sylvestris reached only ca. 4{\%} TMC in the aboveground dry biomass, with the 2{\%} difference largely explained by higher lipid concentrations of treeline pines. We conclude that carbon availability is unlikely to be the cause of the altitudinal tree limit. It seems rather that low temperatures directly affect sink activity at the treeline, with surplus carbon stored in osmotically inactive compounds.},

@article{Korner:2003,
	abstract = {Summary 1 The ongoing enrichment of the atmosphere with CO2 raises the question of whether growth of forest trees, which represent close to 90\% of the global biomass carbon, is still carbon limited at current concentrations of close to 370 p.p.m. As photosynthesis of C3 plants is not CO2-saturated at such concentrations, enhanced `source activity' of leaves could stimulate `sink activity' (i.e. growth) of plants, provided other resources and developmental controls permit. I explore current levels of non-structural carbon in trees in natural forests in order to estimate the potential for a carbon-driven stimulation of growth. 2 The concentration of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in tree tissues is considered a measure of carbon shortage or surplus for growth. A periodic reduction of NSC pools indicates either that carbon demand exceeds con-current supply, or that both source and sink activity are low. A steady, very high NSC concentration is likely to indicate that photosynthesis fully meets, or even exeeds, that needed for growth (surplus assimilates accumulate). 3 The analysis presented here considers data for mature trees in four climatic zones: the high elevation treeline (in Mexico, the Alps and Northern Sweden), a temperate lowland forest of central Europe, Mediterranean sclerophyllous woodland and a semideciduous tropical forest in Panama. 4 In all four climatic regions, periods of reduced or zero growth show maximum C-loading of trees (source activity exceeding demand), except for dry midsummer in the Mediterranean. NSC pools are generally high throughout the year, and are not significantly affected by mass fruiting episodes. 5 It is concluded that, irrespective of the reason for its periodic cessation, growth does not seem to be limited by carbon supply. Instead, in all the cases examined, sink activity and its direct control by the environment or developmental constraints, restricts biomass production of trees under current ambient CO2 concentrations. 6 The current carbohydrate charging of mature wild trees from the tropics to the cold limit of tree growth suggests that little (if any) leeway exists for further CO2-fertilization effects on growth.},

	abstract = {We examined the seasonal variation in total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations in branch, trunk, and root tissues of Anacardiumexcelsum, Lueheaseemannii, Cecropialongipes, and Ureracaracasana growing in a seasonally dry forest in Panama. Our main goals were: (1) to determine the main sites of carbohydrate storage, and (2) to determine if seasonal patterns of carbohydrate storage are related to seasonal asynchronies in carbon supply and demand. We expected asynchronies to be related to seasonal variation in water and light availability and to foliar and reproductive phenology. Cecropia and Urera are fully drought-deciduous and so we expected them to exhibit the most dramatic seasonal variation in TNC concentrations. We predicted that maximum carbon supply would occur when canopies were at their fullest and that maximum carbon demand would occur when leaves, flowers, and fruits were produced. The concentration of total non-structural carbohydrates was assessed monthly in wood tissue of roots and in wood and bark tissue of terminal branches. Trunk tissue was sampled bimonthly. All tissues sampled served as storage sites for carbohydrates. As predicted, TNC concentrations varied most dramatically in branches of Cecropia and Urera: a 4-fold difference was observed between dry season maxima and wet season minima in branch wood tissue. Peak concentrations exceeded 25{\%} in Urera and 30{\%} in Cecropia. Less dramatic but significant seasonal variation was observed in Anacardium and Luehea. In all species, minimum branch TNC concentrations were measured during canopy rebuilding. In Anacardium, maximum branch TNC concentrations occurred when canopies were at their fullest. In Cecropia, Urera, and Luehea, TNC concentrations continued to increase even as canopies thinned in the early dry season. The greater photosynthetic capacity of leaves produced at the beginning of the dry season and the potential for the export of carbohydrates from senescing leaves may explain this pattern. In all species, the phenology of carbon gain was more important than the phenology of reproduction in influencing seasonal carbohydrate patterns. The combination of high TNC concentrations and the large biomass of branches, trunks, and roots indicates these species are storing and moving large quantities of carbohydrates.},

We compared model predictions of NSC ages and transit times for Pinus halepensis, Acer rubrum and Pinus taeda, to understand differences in carbon (C) storage dynamics in species with different leaf phenology and growth environments. ●We used two C allocation models from the literature to estimate the NSC age and transit time distributions, to simulate C limitation, and to evaluate the sensitivity of the mean ages to changes in allocation fluxes. ●Differences in allocation resulted in different NSC age and transit time distributions. The simulated starvation flattened the NSC age distribution and increased the mean NSC transit time, which can be used to estimate the age of the NSC available and the time it would take to exhaust the reserves. Mean NSC ages and transit times were sensitive to C fluxes in roots and allocation of C from wood storage. ●Our results demonstrate how trees with different storage traits are expected to react differently to starvation. They also provide a probabilistic explanation for the `last-in, first-out' pattern of NSC mobilization from well-mixed C pools.},

Roots were sampled from five seasonally dry tropical forests ranging in age from 6 yr to a mature forest. *  Structural carbon in combined live + dead roots picked from soil cores sampled 1 month before the hurricane had mean ages ranging from 4 to 11 yr, whereas live roots alone had ages of 1--2 yr. Structural carbon in new live fine roots produced over a period lasting from 3 wk before the hurricane to 2 months after the event had mean ages of between 2 and 10 yr. *  Contrary to expectations, our results showed that plants allocate long-lived storage carbon pools to the production of new fine roots after canopy defoliation and root mortality.

	abstract = {Summary Nonstructural carbon (NSC) reserves act as buffers to sustain tree activity during periods when carbon (C) assimilation does not meet C demand, but little is known about their age and accessibility; we designed a controlled girdling experiment in the Amazon to study tree survival on NSC reserves. We used bomb-radiocarbon (14C) to monitor the time elapsed between C fixation and release (`age' of substrates). We simultaneously monitored how the mobilization of reserve C affected δ13CO2. Six ungirdled control trees relied almost exclusively on recent assimilates throughout the 17 months of measurement. The Δ14C of CO2 emitted from the six girdled stems increased significantly over time after girdling, indicating substantial remobilization of storage NSC fixed up to 13--14 yr previously. This remobilization was not accompanied by a consistent change in observed δ13CO2. These trees have access to storage pools integrating C accumulated over more than a decade. Remobilization follows a very clear reverse chronological mobilization with younger reserve pools being mobilized first. The lack of a shift in the δ13CO2 might indicate a constant contribution of starch hydrolysis to the soluble sugar pool even outside pronounced stress periods (regular mixing).},

	abstract = {Summary The allocation of nonstructural carbon (NSC) to growth, metabolism and storage remains poorly understood, but is critical for the prediction of stress tolerance and mortality. We used the radiocarbon (14C) `bomb spike' as a tracer of substrate and age of carbon in stemwood NSC, CO2 emitted by stems, tree ring cellulose and stump sprouts regenerated following harvesting in mature red maple trees. We addressed the following questions: which factors influence the age of stemwood NSC?; to what extent is stored vs new NSC used for metabolism and growth?; and, is older, stored NSC available for use? The mean age of extracted stemwood NSC was 10 yr. More vigorous trees had both larger and younger stemwood NSC pools. NSC used to support metabolism (stem CO2) was 1--2 yr old in spring before leaves emerged, but reflected current-year photosynthetic products in late summer. The tree ring cellulose 14C age was 0.9 yr older than direct ring counts. Stump sprouts were formed from NSC up to 17 yr old. Thus, younger NSC is preferentially used for growth and day-to-day metabolic demands. More recently stored NSC contributes to annual ring growth and metabolism in the dormant season, yet decade-old and older NSC is accessible for regrowth.},

	abstract = {Summary Non-structural carbon (NSC) storage (i.e. starch, soluble sugras and lipids) in tree stems play important roles in metabolism and growth. Their spatial distribution in wood may explain species-specific differences in carbon storage dynamics, growth and survival. However, quantitative information on the spatial distribution of starch and lipids in wood is sparse due to methodological limitations. Here we assessed differences in wood NSC and lipid storage between tropical tree species with different growth and mortality rates and contrasting functional types. We measured starch and soluble sugars in wood cores up to 4 cm deep into the stem using standard chemical quantification methods and histological slices stained with Lugol's iodine. We also detected neutral lipids using histological slices stained with Oil-Red-O. The histological method allowed us to group individuals into two categories according to their starch storage strategy: fiber-storing trees and parenchyma-storing trees. The first group had a bigger starch pool, slower growth and lower mortality rates than the second group. Lipid storage was found in wood parenchyma in five species and was related to low mortality rates. The quantification of the spatial distribution of starch and lipids in wood improves our understanding of NSC dynamics in trees and reveals additional dimensions of tree growth and survival strategies.},

@article{Trumbore:2015,
	abstract = {{Trees contain non-structural carbon (NSC), but it is unclear for how long these reserves are stored and to what degree they are used to support plant activity. We used radiocarbon (14C) to show that the carbon (C) in stemwood NSC can achieve ages of several decades in California oaks. We separated NSC into two fractions: soluble (∼50\\% sugars) and insoluble (mostly starch) NSC. Soluble NSC contained more C than insoluble NSC, but we found no consistent trend in the amount of either pool with depth in the stem. There was no systematic difference in C age between the two fractions, although ages increased with stem depth. The C in both NSC fractions was consistently younger than the structural C from which they were extracted. Together, these results indicate considerable inward mixing of NSC within the stem and rapid exchange between soluble and insoluble pools, compared with the timescale of inward mixing. We observed similar patterns in sympatric evergreen and deciduous oaks and the largest differences among tree stems with different growth rates. The 14C signature of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from tree stems was higher than expected from very recent photoassimilates, indicating that the mean age of C in respiration substrates included a contribution from C fixed years previously. A simple model that tracks NSC produced each year, followed by loss (through conversion to CO2) in subsequent years, matches our observations of inward mixing of NSC in the stem and higher 14C signature of stem CO2 efflux. Together, these data support the idea of continuous accumulation of NSC in stemwood and that `vigor' (growth rate) and leaf habit (deciduous vs evergreen) control NSC pool size and allocation.}},

	abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that broad-leaved forest species with contrasting wood anatomy and hydraulic system (ring-porous versus diffuse-porous) also differ in distribution and seasonal dynamics of carbohydrate reserves in stem wood. Total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) reserves (starch and sugars) were measured enzymatically in the 10 youngest stem xylem rings of adult oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees during an annual cycle. Radial distribution of carbohydrates was investigated according to ring age. On all dates, oak trees had twofold higher TNC concentration than beech trees (41 versus 23 mg gDM−1), with starch accounting for the high TNC concentration in oak. Seasonal dynamics of TNC concentration were significantly (P \\&lt; 0.05) more pronounced in oak (20--64 mg TNC gDM−1) than in beech (17--34 mg TNC gDM−1). A marked decrease in TNC concentration was observed in oak trees during bud burst and early wood growth, whereas seasonal fluctuations in TNC concentrations in beech trees were small. The radial distribution of TNC based on ring age differed between species: TNC was restricted to the sapwood rings in oak, whereas in beech, it was distributed throughout the wood from the outermost sapwood ring to the pith. Although the high TNC concentrations in the outermost rings accounted for most of the observed seasonal pattern, all of the 10 youngest xylem rings analyzed participated in the seasonal dynamics of TNC in beech trees. The innermost sapwood rings of oak trees had low TNC concentrations. Stem growth and accumulation of carbon reserves occurred concomitantly during the first part of the season, when there was no soil water deficit. When soil water content was depleted, stem growth ceased in both species, whereas TNC accumulation was negligibly affected and continued until leaf fall. The contrasting dynamics and distribution of carbohydrate reserves in oak and beech are discussed with reference to differences in phenology, early spring growth and hydraulic properties between ring-porous trees and diffuse-porous trees.}},

Even less well understood is the mixing between recent photosynthetic assimilates (new NSC) and previously stored reserves. And, NSC turnover times are poorly constrained. We characterized the distribution of NSC in the stemwood, branches, and roots of two temperate trees, and we used the continuous label offered by the radiocarbon (carbon-14, 14C) bomb spike to estimate the mean age of NSC in different tissues. NSC in branches and the outermost stemwood growth rings had the 14C signature of the current growing season. However, NSC in older aboveground and belowground tissues was enriched in 14C, indicating that it was produced from older assimilates. Radial patterns of 14C in stemwood NSC showed strong mixing of NSC across the youngest growth rings, with limited `mixing in' of younger NSC to older rings. Sugars in the outermost five growth rings, accounting for two-thirds of the stemwood pool, had a mean age < 1 yr, whereas sugars in older growth rings had a mean age > 5 yr. Our results are thus consistent with a previously-hypothesized two-pool (`fast' and `slow' cycling NSC) model structure. These pools appear to be physically distinct.},

	abstract = {Summary Drought regimes can be characterized by the variability in the quantity of rainfall and the duration of rainless periods. However, most research on plant response to drought has ignored the impacts of rainfall variation, especially with regard to the influence of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) in promoting drought resistance. To test the hypothesis that these components of drought differentially affect NSC dynamics and seedling resistance, we tracked NSC in plant tissues of tropical tree seedlings in response to manipulations of the volume and frequency of water applied. NSC concentrations decreased in woody tissues under infrequent--high watering but increased under no watering. A faster decline of growth relative to stomatal conductance in the no watering treatment was consistent with NSC accumulation as a result of an uncoupling of growth and photosynthesis, while usage of stored NSCs in woody tissues to maintain function may account for the NSC decline under infrequent--high watering. NSCs, and specifically stem NSCs, contributed to drought resistance under severe water deficits, while NSCs had a less clear role in drought resistance to variability in water availability. The contrasting response of NSCs to water variability and deficit indicates that unique processes support seedling resistance to these components of drought.},

	abstract = {{Nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) play a critical role in plant physiology and metabolism, yet we know little about their distribution within individual organs such as the stem. This leaves many open questions about whether reserves deep in the stem are metabolically active and available to support functional processes. To gain insight into the availability of reserves, we measured radial patterns of NSCs over the course of a year in the stemwood of temperate trees with contrasting wood anatomy (ring porous vs diffuse porous). In a subset of trees, we estimated the mean age of soluble sugars within and between different organs using the radiocarbon (14C) bomb spike approach. First, we found that NSC concentrations were the highest and most seasonally dynamic in the outermost stemwood segments for both ring-porous and diffuse-porous trees. However, while the seasonal fluctuation of NSCs was dampened in deeper stemwood segments for ring-porous trees, it remained high for diffuse-porous trees. These NSC dynamics align with differences in the proportion of functional sapwood and the arrangement of vessels between ring-porous and diffuse-porous trees. Second, radial patterns of 14C in the stemwood showed that sugars became older when moving toward the pith. The same pattern was found in the coarse roots. Finally, when taken together, our results highlight how the radial distribution and age of NSCs relate to wood anatomy and suggest that while deeper, and likely older, reserves in the stemwood fluctuated across the seasons, the deepest reserves at the center of the stem were not used to support tree metabolism under usual environmental conditions.}},

	abstract = {Human and animals store fat in the form of multiple small intracellular structures, called lipid droplets, in brown adipocytes, and in a single large lipid droplet in white adipocytes. When environmental temperature decreases, white adipocytes can convert into brown adipocytes, in which fat is more accessible for burning and thermogenesis, and vice versa. The mechanism underlying the interconversion between multiple and single lipid droplets is not clear. Here, we report that a nuclear hormone signaling pathway regulates similar conversions in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and that components of this pathway have counterparts in humans.Nuclear receptors play important roles in regulating fat metabolism and energy production in humans. The regulatory functions and endogenous ligands of many nuclear receptors are still unidentified, however. Here, we report that CYP-37A1 (ortholog of human cytochrome P450 CYP4V2), EMB-8 (ortholog of human P450 oxidoreductase POR), and DAF-12 (homolog of human nuclear receptors VDR/LXR) constitute a hormone synthesis and nuclear receptor pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans. This pathway specifically regulates the thermosensitive fusion of fat-storing lipid droplets. CYP-37A1, together with EMB-8, synthesizes a lipophilic hormone not identical to Δ7-dafachronic acid, which represses the fusion-promoting function of DAF-12. CYP-37A1 also negatively regulates thermotolerance and lifespan at high temperature in a DAF-12{\textendash}dependent manner. Human CYP4V2 can substitute for CYP-37A1 in C. elegans. This finding suggests the existence of a conserved CYP4V2-POR{\textendash}nuclear receptor pathway that functions in converting multilocular lipid droplets to unilocular ones in human cells; misregulation of this pathway may lead to pathogenic fat storage.},

	abstract = {Glucocorticoids (GCs) are potent pharmacological agents used to treat a number of immune conditions. GCs are also naturally occurring steroid hormones (e.g. cortisol, corticosterone) produced in response to stressful conditions that are thought to increase the preference for calorie dense {\textquoteleft}comfort{\textquoteright} foods. If chronically elevated, GCs can contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), although the mechanisms for the diabetogenic effects are not entirely clear. The present study proposes a new rodent model to investigate the combined metabolic effects of elevated GCs and high-fat feeding on ectopic fat deposition and diabetes development. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (aged 7{\textendash}8 weeks) received exogenous corticosterone or wax (placebo) pellets, implanted subcutaneously, and were fed either a standard chow diet (SD) or a 60\% high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 days. Animals given corticosterone and a HFD (cort-HFD) had lower body weight and smaller relative glycolytic muscle mass, but increased relative epididymal mass, compared with controls (placebo-SD). Cort-HFD rats exhibited severe hepatic steatosis and increased muscle lipid deposition compared with placebo-SD animals. Moreover, cort-HFD animals were found to exhibit severe fasting hyperglycemia (60\% increase), hyperinsulinemia (80\% increase), insulin resistance (60\% increase) and impaired β-cell response to oral glucose load (20\% decrease) compared with placebo-SD animals. Thus, a metabolic syndrome or T2DM phenotype can be rapidly induced in young Sprague-Dawley rats by using exogenous GCs if a HFD is consumed. This finding might be valuable in examining the physiological and molecular mechanisms of GC-induced metabolic disease.},

@article{Zhou:2019,
	abstract = {Lipid droplets (LDs) have been widely found from diverse species and exhibit diverse functions. It remains unexplored what potential roles they played in tea. To address this question, we analyzed the chemical composition and the dynamic changes of cytosolic LDs during leaf growth and diurnal cycle. Using TopFluor cholesterol and Nile Red staining we demonstrated that cytosolic LDs were heterogeneous in tea tree (Camellia sinensis cv. Tieguanyin); the size and number of LDs increased with leaf growth. Compositional analysis showed that terpenoid esters and diacylglycerol are the major components of cytosolic LDs. The contents of total sterol esters (SEs) and β-amyrin esters increased with leaf expansion and growth; individual SE also showed diurnal changes. Our data suggest that cytosolic LDs from tea tree leave mainly serve as storage site for free sterols and triterpenoids in the form of esters. Cytosolic LDs were not the major contributors to the aroma quality of made tea.},

	n2 = {Food availability in nature changes continually over an organism's lifetime. As such, animals must diligently assess resource availability and appropriately allocate reserves that have been stored during times of feast for reproduction, to abate evolutionary pressures during times of famine. Our findings functionally link the availability of somatic (survival-promoting) and germline (reproduction-promoting) lipids to SKN-1 responses to oxidative and nutrient stress. We have defined this physiological response at the molecular, genetic, and organismal levels and identified a specific signaling system for regulating this process within intact animals. These findings will inform not only laboratory-based studies, but also ecological studies that have long sought to functionally integrate oxidative stress responses (like the SKN-1 pathway) into life-history traits.Animals in nature are continually challenged by periods of feast and famine as resources inevitably fluctuate, and must allocate somatic reserves for reproduction to abate evolutionary pressures. We identify an age-dependent lipid homeostasis pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans that regulates the mobilization of lipids from the soma to the germline, which supports fecundity but at the cost of survival in nutrient-poor and oxidative stress environments. This trade-off is responsive to the levels of dietary carbohydrates and organismal oleic acid and is coupled to activation of the cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1 in both laboratory-derived and natural isolates of C. elegans. The homeostatic balance of lipid stores between the somatic and germ cells is mediated by arachidonic acid (omega-6) and eicosapentaenoic acid (omega-3) precursors of eicosanoid signaling molecules. Our results describe a mechanism for resource reallocation within intact animals that influences reproductive fitness at the cost of somatic resilience.},

Whereas TAGs are present in all types of cell, the occurrence of SEs in prokaryotes is questionable, and the presence of WEs as storage molecules is restricted to plants and a few bacteria. Here, we summarize recent knowledge on the formation, storage and degradation of TAGs and SEs in various cell types. We describe the biochemical pathways involved in TAG and SE synthesis and discuss the subcellular compartmentation of these processes. Recently, several novel enzymes governing the metabolism of storage lipids have been identified and characterized. Regulatory aspects of neutral lipid storage are just beginning to be understood. Finally, we describe consequences of defects in neutral lipid metabolism. Since severe diseases like atherosclerosis, obesity and type 2 diabetes are caused by lipid accumulation, mechanisms underlying neutral lipid synthesis, depot formation and mobilization are of major interest for curing such diseases that are increasingly associated with modern civilization.},

	abstract = {Variations in the concentration and composition of triacylglycerols, free fatty acids and phospholipids were analyzed in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees at five sites. Disks were taken at breast height or at a height of 4 m from the stems of 81 trees differing in diameter and growth rate. The mean concentration of triacylglycerols in sapwood was 26 mg g−1 dry mass; however, variation among trees was large (16--51 mg gdm−1). The concentration of triacylglycerols was slightly larger at 4 m height in the stem than at breast height. Concentrations of triacylglycerols did not differ between the sapwood of young and small-diameter stems (DBH {$<$} 12 cm) and the sapwood of old stems (DBH {$>$} 36 cm). Concentrations of free fatty acids were negligible in the outer sapwood, but ranged between 5 and 18 mg gdm−1 in the heartwood. The most abundant fatty acids of triacylglycerols were oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2ω6, 18:2Δ5,9), linolenic (pinolenic, 18:3Δ5,9,12 and 18:3ω3) and eicosatrienoic acid (20:3Δ5,11,14 and 20:3ω6). The concentration of linoleic acid comprised 39--46{\%} of the triacylglycerol fatty acids and the concentration was higher in the slow-growing stem from northern Finland than in the stems from southern Finland. Major phospholipids were detected only in sapwood, and only traces of lipid phosphorus were detected in heartwood.},

	abstract = {Lipid droplets are cytoplasmic organelles that store neutral lipids and are critically important for energy metabolism. Their function in energy storage is firmly established and increasingly well characterized. However, emerging evidence indicates that lipid droplets also play important and diverse roles in the cellular handling of lipids and proteins that may not be directly related to energy homeostasis. Lipid handling roles of droplets include the storage of hydrophobic vitamin and signaling precursors, and the management of endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress. Roles of lipid droplets in protein handling encompass functions in the maturation, storage, and turnover of cellular and viral polypeptides. Other potential roles of lipid droplets may be connected with their intracellular motility and, in some cases, their nuclear localization. This diversity highlights that lipid droplets are very adaptable organelles, performing different functions in different biological contexts.

Lipids play a crucial role in the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity of the water-conducting elements and cells of the resurrection plant Myrothamnus flabellifolia during complete dehydration. ??

Significant findings include: a discontinuity in the branch xylem between an inner zone where no water moves and an outer zone where the water moves; the blocking of water movement in the inner zone by lipids that are not dispersed by water, and the facilitation of water advance in the xylem elements and pits of the outer zone by water-dispersed lipids; the relative impermeability of leaf trace xylem to the rehydrating water and, hence, the relative hydraulic isolation of the leaves. ?? These results elucidated part of the strategy used by the resurrection plant to cope with extreme drought and to minimize transpirational water loss upon hydration.},

Many of its lipid genes are conserved in humans and are associated with metabolic syndrome or other diseases. Examination of lipid accumulation in this organism can be carried out by fixative dyes or label-free methods. Fixative stains like Nile red and oil red O are inexpensive, reliable ways to quantitatively measure lipid levels and to qualitatively observe lipid distribution across tissues, respectively. Moreover, these stains allow for high-throughput screening of various lipid metabolism genes and pathways. Additionally, their hydrophobic nature facilitates lipid solubility, reduces interaction with surrounding tissues, and prevents dissociation into the solvent. Though these methods are effective at examining general lipid content, they do not provide detailed information about the chemical composition and diversity of lipid deposits. For these purposes, label-free methods such as GC-MS and CARS microscopy are better suited, their costs notwithstanding.},

Reserve materials might be important for wood formation in trees. The localization and approximate levels of starch and lipids (as droplets) and number of starch granules in cambium and phloem were examined from cambial dormancy to the start of xylem differentiation in locally heated stems of Cryptomeria japonica trees in winter.Electric heating tape was wrapped on one side of the stem of Cryptomeria japonica trees at breast height in winter. The localization and approximate levels of starch and lipids (as droplets) and number of starch granules were determined by image analysis of optical digital images obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy.Localized heating induced earlier cambial reactivation and xylem differentiation in stems of Cryptomeria japonica, as compared with non-heated stems. There were clear changes in the respective localizations and levels of starch and lipids (as droplets) determined in terms of relative areas on images, from cambial dormancy to the start of xylem differentiation in heated stems. In heated stems, the levels and number of starch granules fell from cambial reactivation to the start of xylem differentiation. There was a significant decrease in the relative area occupied by lipid droplets in the cambium from cambial reactivation to the start of xylem differentiation in heated stems.The results showed clearly that the levels and number of storage starch granules in cambium and phloem cells and levels of lipids (as droplets) in the cambium decreased from cambial reactivation to the start of xylem differentiation in heated stems during the winter. The observations suggest that starch and lipid droplets might be needed as sources of energy for the initiation of cambial cell division and the differentiation of xylem in Cryptomeria japonica.},

	abstract = {Wood biophysical properties and the dynamics of water storage discharge and refilling were studied in the trunk of canopy tree species with diverse life history and functional traits in subtropical forests of northeast Argentina. Multiple techniques assessing capacitance and storage capacity were used simultaneously to improve our understanding of the functional significance of internal water sources in trunks of large trees. Sapwood capacitances of 10 tree species were characterized using pressure--volume relationships of sapwood samples obtained from the trunk. Frequency domain reflectometry was used to continuously monitor the volumetric water content in the main stems. Simultaneous sap flow measurements on branches and at the base of the tree trunk, as well as diurnal variations in trunk contraction and expansion, were used as additional measures of stem water storage use and refilling dynamics. All evidence indicates that tree trunk internal water storage contributes from 6 to 28{\%} of the daily water budget of large trees depending on the species. The contribution of stored water in stems of trees to total daily transpiration was greater for deciduous species, which exhibited higher capacitance and lower sapwood density. A linear relationship across species was observed between wood density and growth rates with the higher wood density species (mostly evergreen) associated with lower growth rates and the lower wood density species (mostly deciduous) associated with higher growth rates. The large sapwood capacitance in deciduous species may help to avoid catastrophic embolism in xylem conduits. This may be a low-cost adaptation to avoid water deficits during peak water use at midday and under temporary drought periods and will contribute to higher growth rates in deciduous tree species compared with evergreen ones. Large capacitance appears to have a central role in the rapid growth patterns of deciduous species facilitating rapid canopy access as these species are less shade tolerant than evergreen species.},

	abstract = {Trees of tropical semi-deciduous forests range from ``drought-avoiding''stem-succulent species with low- density wood ({$<$} 0.5 g cm−3), which maintain high stem water potentials (ΨSTEM {$>$} −0.7 MPa) throughout the year, to ``drought-tolerant''deciduous hardwood species (wood density {$>$} 0.75 g cm−3), which dehydrate strongly during seasonal drought (ΨSTEM {$<$} −6 MPa). In stem-succulent and other drought-avoiding species, xylem vessels are surrounded by extensive parenchyma providing intracellular water storage, whereas in deciduous species stem water storage is mainly extracellular. Thirteen tropical and two temperate tree species, representing different functional types, were studied. The contribution of stem water storage to these species' water use during water stress was determined by time-series analysis of dehydration and rehydration of excised leaf-bearing branches of these trees. During dehydration, stem water potential slowly declined 1--2 MPa in drought-avoiding species, but in deciduous species it rapidly fell 4--5 MPa, suggesting that water storage capacitance was related to xylem anatomy. After immersion of dehydrated, leafless branches in water, the decline in xylem tension and rate of water uptake during rehydration were linearly related, as predicted by application of Ohm's law to water flux. The decline of xylem tension during rehydration was biphasic, with a phase of rapid water uptake into extracellular spaces being followed by a prolonged phase of slow water uptake into living cells. The rate of water uptake during rehydration and the minima of leaf water potential observed in the field during the dry season were highly correlated with water storage capacitance, indicating that wood anatomy is a major determinant of drought adaptation.},

	abstract = {The diversity of expression in axial parenchyma (or lack of it) in woods is reviewed and synthesized with recent work in wood physiology, and questions and hypotheses relative to axial parenchyma anatomy are offered. Cell shape, location, abundance, size, wall characteristics and contents are all characteristics for the assessment of the physiological functions of axial parenchyma, a tissue that has been neglected in the consideration of how wood histology has evolved. Axial parenchyma occurrence should be considered with respect to mechanisms for the prevention and reversal of embolisms in tracheary elements. This mechanism complements cohesion--tension-based water movement and root pressure as a way of maintaining flow in xylem. Septate fibres can substitute for axial parenchyma (`axial parenchyma absent') and account for water movement in xylem and for the supply of carbohydrate abundance underlying massive and sudden events of foliation, flowering and fruiting, as can fibre dimorphism and the co-occurrence of septate fibres and axial parenchyma. Rayless woods may or may not contain axial parenchyma and are informative when analysing parenchyma function. Interconnections between ray and axial parenchyma are common, and so axial and radial parenchyma must be considered as complementary parts of a network, with distinctive but interactive functions. Upright ray cells and more numerous rays per millimetre enhance interconnection and are more often found in woods that contain tracheids. Vesselless woods in both gymnosperms and angiosperms have axial parenchyma, the distribution of which suggests a function in osmotic water shifting. Water and photosynthate storage in axial parenchyma may be associated with seasonal changes and with succulent or subsucculent modes of construction. Apotracheal axial parenchyma distribution often demonstrates storage functions that can be read independently of osmotic water shifting capabilities. Axial parenchyma may serve to both enhance mechanical strength or, when parenchyma is thin-walled, as a tissue that adapts to volume change with a change in water content. Other functions of axial parenchyma (contributing resistance to pathogens; a site for the recovery of physical damage) are considered. The diagnostic features of axial parenchyma and septate fibres are reviewed in order to clarify distinctions and to aid in cell type identification. Systematic listings are given for particular axial parenchyma conditions (e.g. axial parenchyma `absent'with septate fibres substituting). A knowledge of the axial parenchyma information presented here is desirable for a full understanding of xylem function.},

	abstract = {Dimorphic fibres in angiosperm woods are designated when zones of two different kinds of fibres can be distinguished in transverse sections. The usage of most authors contrasts wider, thinner-walled, shorter (sometimes storied) fibres with narrower, thicker-walled fibres that have narrower lumina. The wider fibres can be distinguished in longitudinal sections from axial parenchyma, which usually consists of strands of two or more cells each surrounded by secondary walls (and thus different from septate fibres). This phenomenon occurs in some Araliaceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Myrtales (notably Lythraceae), Sapindales (especially Sapindaceae), Urticales and even some Gnetales. Additional instances can doubtless be found, especially if instances of wide latewood fibres together with narrow earlywood fibres are included. There is little physiological evidence on differential functions of dimorphic fibres, except in Acer, in which hydrolysis of starch in the wide fibres is known to result in transfer of sugar into vessels early in the growing season. Starch storage in axial parenchyma may, in a complementary way, serve for embolism reversal and prevention and thus for maintenance of the water columns. Crystalliferous fibres (Myrtales, Sapindales) can be considered a form of fibre dimorphism that deters predation. Gelatinous fibres, often equated with tension wood, can also be considered as a form of fibre dimorphism. The evolutionary significance of fibre dimorphism is that a few small changes in fibre structure can result in the accomplishment of diversified functions.},

This model, simplistic in its design, shows how a large woody perennial is highly compartmented. Anatomical divisions in place at the time of infection or damage, (physical defense) alongside the `active'response by the RAP during and after wounding work together in forming boundaries that function to restrict air or decay spread. The living parenchyma cells play a critical role in all of the four walls (differing anatomical constructs) that the model comprises. To understand how living cells in each of the walls of CODIT cooperate, we must have a clear vision of their complex interconnectivity from a three-dimensional perspective, along with knowledge of the huge variation in ray parenchyma (RP) and axial parenchyma (AP) abundance and patterns. Crucial patterns for defense encompass the symplastic continuum between both RP and AP and the dead tissues, with the latter including the vessel elements, libriform fibers, and imperforate tracheary elements (i.e., vasicentric and vascular tracheids). Also, the heartwood, a chemically altered antimicrobial non-living substance that forms the core of many trees, provides an integral part of the defense system. In the heartwood, dead RAP can play an important role in defense, depending on the genetic constitution of the species. Considering the array of functions that RAP are associated with, from capacitance, through to storage, and long-distance water transport, deciding how their role in defense fits into this suite of functions is a challenge for plant scientists, and likely depends on a range of factors. Here, we explore the important role of RAP in defense against fungal pathogens and the trade-offs involved from a viewpoint for structure-function relations, while also examining how fungi can breach the defense system using an array of enzymes in conjunction with the physically intrusive hyphae.},

	abstract = {The fungal cell wall is located outside the plasma membrane and is the cell compartment that mediates all the relationships of the cell with the environment. It protects the contents of the cell, gives rigidity and defines the cellular structure. The cell wall is a skeleton with high plasticity that protects the cell from different stresses, among which osmotic changes stand out. The cell wall allows interaction with the external environment since some of its proteins are adhesins and receptors. Since, some components have a high immunogenic capacity, certain wall components can drive the host's immune response to promote fungus growth and dissemination. The cell wall is a characteristic structure of fungi and is composed mainly of glucans, chitin and glycoproteins. As the components of the fungal cell wall are not present in humans, this structure is an excellent target for antifungal therapy. In this article, we review recent data on the composition and synthesis, influence of the components of the cell wall in fungi-host interaction and the role as a target for the next generation of antifungal drugs in yeasts (Candida and Cryptococcus) and filamentous fungi (Aspergillus).},

	abstract = {Quantitative wood anatomy analyzes the variability of xylem anatomical features in trees, shrubs, and herbaceous species to address research questions related to plant functioning, growth, and environment. Among the more frequently considered anatomical features are lumen dimensions and wall thickness of conducting cells, fibers, and several ray properties. The structural properties of each xylem anatomical feature are mostly fixed once they are formed, and define to a large extent its functionality, including transport and storage of water, nutrients, sugars, and hormones, and providing mechanical support. The anatomical features can often be localized within an annual growth ring, which allows to establish intra-annual past and present structure-function relationships and its sensitivity to environmental variability. However, there are many methodological challenges to handle when aiming at producing (large) data sets of xylem anatomical data. Here we describe the different steps from wood sample collection to xylem anatomical data, provide guidance and identify pitfalls, and present different image-analysis tools for the quantification of anatomical features, in particular conducting cells. We show that each data production step from sample collection in the field, microslide preparation in the lab, image capturing through an optical microscope and image analysis with specific tools can readily introduce measurement errors between 5 and 30{\%} and more, whereby the magnitude usually increases the smaller the anatomical features. Such measurement errors-if not avoided or corrected-may make it impossible to extract meaningful xylem anatomical data in light of the rather small range of variability in many anatomical features as observed, for example, within time series of individual plants. Following a rigid protocol and quality control as proposed in this paper is thus mandatory to use quantitative data of xylem anatomical features as a powerful source for many research topics.},

We constructed ring-width and ray-parenchyma chronologies from 1965 to 2004 for 20 Juniperus thurifera trees growing in a Mediterranean continental climate. Chronologies were related to climate records by means of correlation, multiple regression and partial correlation analyses. Ray parenchyma responded to climatic conditions at critical stages during the xylogenetic process; namely, at the end of the previous year's xylogenesis (October) and at the onset of earlywood (May) and latewood formation (August). Ray parenchyma-based chronologies have potential to complement ring-width chronologies as a tool for climate reconstructions. Furthermore, medium- and low-frequency signals in the variation of ray parenchyma may improve our understanding of how trees respond to environmental fluctuations and to global change.},

If the capacity for storage is subject to selection, then the fraction of wood occupied by living parenchyma should increase towards stressful environments. Ray parenchyma fraction (RPF) and seasonal NSC dynamics were quantified for 12 conifers and three oaks along a transect spanning warm dry foothills (500 m above sea level) to cold wet treeline (3250 m asl) in California's central Sierra Nevada. Mean RPF was lower for both conifer and oak species with warmer dryer ranges. RPF variability increased with elevation or in relation to associated climatic variables in conifers ? treeline-dominant Pinus albicaulis had the lowest mean RPF measured (c. 3.7{\%}), but the highest environmentally standardized variability index. Conifer RPF variability was explained by environment, increasing predominantly towards cooler wetter range edges. In oaks, NSC was explained by environment ? values increasing for evergreen and decreasing for deciduous oaks with elevation. Lastly, all species surveyed appear to prioritize filling available RPF with sugar to achieve molarities that balance reasonable tensions over starch to maximize stored carbon. RPF responds to environment but is unlikely to spatially constrain NSC storage.},

	n2 = {Background Vessel-associated cells (VACs) are highly specialized, living parenchyma cells that are in direct contact with water-conducting, dead vessels. The contact may be sparse or in large tight groups of parenchyma that completely surrounds vessels. VACs differ from vessel distant parenchyma in physiology, anatomy, and function and have half-bordered pits at the vessel-parenchyma juncture. The distinct anatomy of VACs is related to the exchange of substances to and from the water-transport system, with the cells long thought to be involved in water transport in woody angiosperms, but where direct experimental evidence is lacking. Scope This review focuses on our current knowledge of VACs regarding anatomy and function, including hydraulic capacitance, storage of nonstructural carbohydrates, symplastic and apoplastic interactions, defense against pathogens and frost, osmoregulation, and the novel hypothesis of surfactant production. Based on microscopy, we visually represent how VACs vary in dimensions and general appearance between species, with special attention to the protoplast, amorphous layer, and the vessel-parenchyma pit membrane. Conclusions An understanding of the relationship between VACs and vessels is crucial to tackling questions related to how water is transported over long distances in xylem, as well as defense against pathogens. New avenues of research show how parenchyma-vessel contact is related to vessel diameter and a new hypothesis may explain how surfactants arising from VAC can allow water to travel under negative pressure. We also reinforce the message of connectivity between VAC and other cells between xylem and phloem.},

Currently, we lack a large-scale quantitative analysis of ray parenchyma (RP) and axial parenchyma (AP) tissue fractions. Here, we use data from the literature on AP and RP fractions to investigate the potential relationships of climate and growth form with total ray and axial parenchyma fractions (RAP). We found a 29-fold variation in RAP fraction, which was more strongly related to temperature than with precipitation. Stem succulents had the highest RAP values (mean $\pm$SD: 70.2 $\pm$22.0{\%}), followed by lianas (50.1 $\pm$16.3{\%}), angiosperm trees and shrubs (26.3 $\pm$12.4{\%}), and conifers (7.6 $\pm$2.6{\%}). Differences in RAP fraction between temperate and tropical angiosperm trees (21.1 $\pm$7.9{\%} vs 36.2 $\pm$13.4{\%}, respectively) are due to differences in the AP fraction, which is typically three times higher in tropical than in temperate trees, but not in RP fraction. Our results illustrate that both temperature and growth form are important drivers of RAP fractions. These findings should help pave the way to better understand the various functions of RAP in plants.},

The conventional theory suggests that NSC reserves will increase over the growing season and decrease over the dormant season. Here, we compare storage in five temperate tree species to determine the size and seasonal fluctuation of whole-tree total NSC pools as well as the contribution of individual organs. NSC concentrations in the branches, stemwood, and roots of 24 trees were measured across 12 months. We then scaled up concentrations to the whole-tree and ecosystem levels using allometric equations and forest stand inventory data. While whole-tree total NSC pools followed the conventional theory, sugar pools peaked in the dormant season and starch pools in the growing season. Seasonal depletion of total NSCs was minimal at the whole-tree level, but substantial at the organ level, particularly in branches. Surprisingly, roots were not the major storage organ as branches stored comparable amounts of starch throughout the year, and root reserves were not used to support springtime growth. Scaling up NSC concentrations to the ecosystem level, we find that commonly used, process-based ecosystem and land surface models all overpredict NSC storage.},

	abstract = {For trees to survive, they must allocate resources between sources and sinks to maintain proper function. The vertical transport pathway in tree stems is essential for carbohydrates and other solutes to move between the canopy and the root system. To date, research and models emphasize the role of tree stems as `express'sugar highways. However, recent investigations using isotopic markers suggest that there is considerable storage and exchange of phloem-transported sugars with older carbon (C) reserves within the stem. Thus, we suggest that stems play an important role not only in long-distance transport, but also in the regulation of the tree's overall C balance. A quantitative partitioning of stem C inputs among storage and sinks, including tissue growth, respiration, and export to roots, is still lacking. Combining methods to better quantify the dynamics and controls of C storage and remobilization in the stem will help to resolve central questions of allocation and C balance in trees.},

	n2 = {Summary ? Severe drought may increase physiological stress on long-lived woody vegetation, occasionally leading to mortality of overstory trees. Little is known about the factors determining tree survival and subsequent recovery after drought. ? We used structural equation modeling to analyse the recovery of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) trees 4?yr after an extreme drought episode occurred in 2004?2005 in north-east Spain. Measured variables included the amount of green foliage, carbon reserves in the stem, mistletoe (Viscum album) infection, needle physiological performance and stem radial growth before, during and after the drought event. ? The amount of green leaves and the levels of carbon reserves were related to the impact of drought on radial growth, and mutually correlated. However, our most likely path model indicated that current depletion of carbon reserves was a result of reduced photosynthetic tissue. This relationship potentially constitutes a feedback limiting tree recovery. In addition, mistletoe infection reduced leaf nitrogen content, negatively affecting growth. Finally, successive surveys in 2009?2010 showed a direct association between carbon reserves depletion and drought-induced mortality. ? Severe drought events may induce long-term physiological disorders associated with canopy defoliation and depletion of carbon reserves, leading to prolonged recovery of surviving individuals and, eventually, to delayed tree death.},

	n2 = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) are used as proxies for the net carbon balance of trees and as indicators of carbon starvation resulting from environmental stress. Woody organs are the largest NSC-storing compartments in forest ecosystems; therefore, it is essential to understand the factors that affect the size of this important storage pool. In wood, NSC are predominantly deposited in ray and axial parenchyma (RAP); however, direct links between nutrient storage and RAP anatomy have not yet been established. Here, we tested whether the NSC storage capacity of wood is influenced by the amount of RAP. METHODS: We measured NSC concentrations and RAP fractions in root and stem sapwood of 12 temperate species sampled at the onset of winter dormancy and in stem sapwood of four tropical trees growing in an evergreen lowland rainforest. The patterns of starch distribution were visualized by staining with Lugol's solution. KEY RESULTS: The concentration of NSCs in sapwood of temperate trees scales tightly with the amount of RAP and living fibers (LFs), with almost all RAP and LFs being densely packed with starch grains. In contrast, the tropical species had lower NSC concentrations despite their higher RAP and LFs fraction and had considerable interspecific differences in starch distribution. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in RAP and LFs abundance affect the ability of sapwood to store NSC in temperate trees, whereas a more diverse set of functions of RAP might be pronounced in species growing in a tropical environment with little seasonality.},

Destructive techniques at coarse spatial scales exist to quantify starch, but these techniques face methodological challenges that can lead to uncertainty about the lability of tissue-specific starch pools and their role in plant survival. Here, we demonstrate how X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) and a machine learning algorithm can be coupled to quantify plant starch content in vivo, repeatedly and nondestructively over time in grapevine stems (Vitis spp.). Starch content estimated for xylem axial and ray parenchyma cells from microCT images was correlated strongly with enzymatically measured bulk-tissue starch concentration on the same stems. After validating our machine learning algorithm, we then characterized the spatial distribution of starch concentration in living stems at micrometer resolution, and identified starch depletion in live plants under experimental conditions designed to halt photosynthesis and starch production, initiating the drawdown of stored starch pools. Using X-ray microCT technology for in vivo starch monitoring should enable novel research directed at resolving the spatial and temporal patterns of starch accumulation and depletion in woody plant species.},

We completely darkened and subsequently released seedlings of two deciduous and two evergreen temperate tree species for varying periods. NSCs were measured in all major organs, allowing assessment of whole-seedling NSC balances. NSCs decreased fast in darkness, but seedlings survived species-specific whole-seedling starch concentrations as low as 0.4?0.8{\%} per dry matter (DM), and sugar (sucrose, glucose and fructose) concentrations as low as 0.5?2.0{\%} DM. After re-illumination, the refilling of NSC pools began within 3 wk, while the resumption of growth was delayed or restricted. All seedlings had died after 12 wk of darkness, and starch and sugar concentrations in most tissues were lower than 1{\%} DM. We conclude that under the applied conditions, tree seedlings can survive several weeks with very low NSC reserves probably also using alternative C sources like lipids, proteins or hemicelluloses; lethal C starvation cannot be assumed, if NSC concentrations are higher than the minimum concentrations found in surviving seedlings; and NSC reformation after re-illumination occurs preferentially over growth.},

This review summarizes how tissue concentrations of nonstructural carbon (C) reserves compounds can be used to assess the C-supply status of trees. Studies that investigated the tissue concentrations of C-reserves and their seasonal variations in trees growing under natural conditions suggested that tree growth and reproduction are currently not limited by photosynthesis under benign or non-stressful climatic conditions. The comparative analysis of C-reserves in trees exposed to environmental stresses like cold temperatures and drought revealed that against previous assumption, the stress-induced decline of growth is also not caused by insufficient C-assimilation. However, recent studies on the C-relation in dying trees exposed to sustained drought indicated organ-specific different reactions of tissue C-reserve concentrations, probably as a result of impaired C-transport and reserve re-mobilization under drought stress.},

@article{Hartmann:2018aa,
	abstract = {Carbohydrates play a central role in plant functioning because they are building blocks and energy carriers for plant metabolic processes. Because plants are sessile organisms and cannot escape stressful environments they acclimate to unfavourable conditions by strategically allocating carbohydrate resources to overcome stress and promote survival, and build reserves for later use when demand is greater than supply from photosynthesis, like after defoliation. A mechanistic understanding of how plants and, in particular, long-lived organisms like trees allocate and remobilize stored carbohydrates is still very poor. Without such an understanding, however, integration of carbon dynamics from trees to ecosystems and to the globe becomes highly uncertain, especially under ongoing climate change. Studies of carbohydrate dynamics in trees are often carried out on tree seedlings due to logistical and technical constraints and criticism has been raised whether results can be extrapolated to mature trees. Here we combine a literature review with a critical evaluation of using seedling studies on carbohydrate dynamics to infer mature tree responses that can subsequently be integrated at ecosystem level and beyond. Despite obvious differences between seedlings and mature trees with respect to carbohydrate dynamics, we propose that a combination of approaches, including seedling studies in controlled environments, measurements on mature trees in the field and ecosystem flux measurements, may provide sound estimates of carbohydrate dynamics at larger scales. We show how sensitive predictions of vegetation responses to disturbance are to changes in available reserves and argue that the implementation of more realistic representations of storage dynamics will likely improve simulations of vegetation responses to environmental stress.},

	abstract = {Three-year-old saplings of Pinus sylvestris L. were labeled with 13CO2 prior to inoculating the trunk with Ophiostoma brunneo ciliatum, a blue-staining fungus usually associated to Ips sexdentatus. During incubation, half the trees were submitted to a severe drought that decreased photosynthesis and natural 13C content in non-labeled saplings. A large 13C-excess was obtained in wood and phloem, especially in the fractions of soluble proteins, starch and soluble sugars of labeled saplings. Drought increased 13C-excess, due to reduced photosynthesis and smaller dilution of 13C by the addition of newly assimilated 12C. The induced-reaction zones in inoculated saplings displayed large total C (58 g 100 g−1) because of the accumulation of secondary metabolites. They also showed much larger 13C-excess than any other compartment: the contribution of stored C to the reaction zones was much higher than that of currently assimilated C. Moreover, drought lowered the contribution of the latter, as shown by the increase of 13C in the reaction zones. We conclude that stored C was readily mobilized for the construction of reaction tissues, and that the contribution of currently assimilated C was only minor.},

	abstract = {Mast seeding, the synchronous intermittent production of large seed crops in populations of perennial plants, is a widespread and widely studied phenomenon. Economy of scale has been demonstrated to provide the ultimate selection factor driving the evolution of masting, for example, in terms of the predator-satiation and pollination-efficiency hypotheses; however, its physiological mechanism is still poorly understood. The resource budget (RB) model assumes that an individual plant requires more resources to flower and fruit than it gains in a year, and therefore only flowers when a specific threshold amount of stored resources is surpassed. Although the RB models have been well explored theoretically, including for resource depletion and pollen coupling, empirical data to support these assumptions are still disputed. Here, we explore the extent to which the RB model applies to masting tree species, focusing on the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen resources in natural temperate forests. There is little empirical evidence that plants use carbohydrates stored over several years to produce fruits; however, nitrogen stores in temperate trees are more commonly depleted after masting. We review the internal nitrogen cycle including resorption during leaf senescence, storage and remobilization, discussing the effect of masting on these processes. Overall, carbohydrates and nitrogen are clearly involved in the proximate mechanisms driving mast seeding, but the determinant resource seems to be species specific.},

The resource budget model, based on the assumption that abundant seeding in a masting year depends on the abundance of resources stored over several years, is a key hypothesis in explaining the mechanism of masting. But do masting species really need such long-term storage to produce a large seed crop? To test this hypothesis, we studied the relationship between the carbon accumulation period for seed production, as estimated by radiocarbon (14C) analyses, and the coefficient of variation of annual seed production in 10 canopy tree species in a temperate deciduous forest. These species differ widely in their reproductive intervals. In all the species studied, the accumulation period was < 1.4 years before seed maturation. Moreover, without taking species or reproductive intervals into account, there was no significant correlation between the carbon accumulation period and the fluctuation of annual seed production; both remained at an even level. Synthesis. Our results suggest that temperate canopy trees used photosynthates produced in the current and/or the previous year for seed production, regardless of reproductive intervals. It might therefore be necessary to reconsider the importance of stored carbohydrate resources for masting.},

Preliminary tests showed that ultrasound caused no damage to cell membrane integrity nor did they cause xylem embolism. The number of VAC with high starch content (HSC-cells) was estimated microscopically by counting the cells with more than 50{\%} of their lumen filled with starch granules. Sonication had no effect on HSC-cells in twigs from watered plants while it induced a drop in the percentage HSC-cells from 80 to 40{\%} in twigs from stressed plants, at the ultrasound source location. No effect was recorded in these twigs 20 mm from the ultrasound source.

Xylem refilling was measured by recording the percentage loss of hydraulic conductance (PLC) with respect to the maximum 2?min, 20?min and 15?h after pressure release. Sodium orthovanadate (an inhibitor of many ATP-ases) strongly inhibited xylem refilling while fusicoccin (a stimulator of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase) promoted complete embolism reversal. So, the refilling process was interpreted to result from energy-dependent mechanisms. Stem girdling induced progressively larger inhibition to refilling the nearer to the embolized stem segment phloem was removed. The starch content of wood parenchyma was estimated as percentages of ray and vasicentric cells with high starch content with respect to the total, before and after stem embolism was induced. A closely linear positive relationship was found to exist between recovery from PLC and starch hydrolysis. This, was especially evident in vasicentric cells. A mechanism for xylem refilling based upon starch to sugar conversion and transport into embolized conduits, assisted by phloem pressure-driven radial mass flow is proposed.},

	abstract = {Nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) remobilization remains poorly understood in trees. In particular, it remains unclear (i) which tissues (e.g., living bark or xylem) and compounds (sugars or starch) in woody plants are the main sources of remobilized carbon, (ii) to what extent these NSC pools can be depleted and (iii) whether initial NSC mass or concentration is a better predictor of regrowth potential following disturbance. To address these questions, we collected root segments from a large mature trembling aspen stand; we then allowed them to resprout (sucker) in the dark and remobilize NSC until all sprouts had died. We found that initial starch mass, not concentration, was the best predictor of subsequent sprout mass. In total, more NSC mass (\~{}4×) was remobilized from the living inner bark than the xylem of the roots. After resprouting, root starch was generally depleted to {$<$}0.6{\%} w/w in both tissues. In contrast, a large portion of sugars appear unavailable for remobilization: sugar concentrations were only reduced to 12{\%} w/w in the bark and 2{\%} in the xylem. These findings suggest that in order to test whether plant processes like resprouting are limited by storage we need to (i) measure storage in the living bark, not just the xylem, (ii) consider storage pool size---not just concentration---and (iii) carefully determine which compounds are actually components of the storage pool.},

Here, we analyzed diurnal NSC dynamics in the overall architecture of almond (Prunus dulcis) trees. We also analyzed the allocation of newly assimilated carbon using isotopic labeling. We show that both components of NSC (i.e. soluble carbohydrates and starch) are highly dynamic at the diurnal time scale and that these trends are influenced by tissue type, age, and/or position within the canopy. In leaves, starch reserves can be depleted completely during the night, while woody tissue starch levels may vary by more than 50{\%} over a daily cycle. Recently assimilated carbon showed a dispersed downward allocation across the entire tree. NSC diurnal fluctuations within the tree's structure in combination with dispersed carbon allocation patterns provide evidence for the presence of vertical mixing and suggest that the xylem acts as a secondary NSC redistribution pathway.},

@article{Sala:2012aa,
	abstract = {Research on the degree to which carbon (C) availability limits growth in trees, as well as recent trends in climate change and concurrent increases in drought-related tree mortality, have led to a renewed focus on the physiological mechanisms associated with tree growth responses to current and future climate. This has led to some dispute over the role of stored non-structural C compounds as indicators of a tree's current demands for photosynthate. Much of the uncertainty surrounding this issue could be resolved by developing a better understanding of the potential functions of non-structural C stored within trees. In addition to functioning as a buffer to reconcile temporal asynchrony between C demand and supply, the storage of non-structural C compounds may be under greater regulation than commonly recognized. We propose that in the face of environmental stochasticity, large, long-lived trees may require larger C investments in storage pools as safety margins than previously recognized, and that an important function of these pools may be to maintain hydraulic transport, particularly during episodes of severe stress. If so, survival and long-term growth in trees remain a function of C availability. Given that drought, freeze--thaw events and increasing tree height all impose additional constraints on vascular transport, the common trend of an increase in non-structural carbohydrate concentrations with tree size, drought or cold is consistent with our hypothesis. If the regulated maintenance of relatively large constitutive stored C pools in trees serves to maintain hydraulic integrity, then the minimum thresholds are expected to vary depending on the specific tissues, species, environment, growth form and habit. Much research is needed to elucidate the extent to which allocation of C to storage in trees is a passive vs. an active process, the specific functions of stored C pools, and the factors that drive active C allocation to storage.},

@article{Sevanto:2014ab,
	abstract = {Drought challenges plant water uptake and the vascular system. In the xylem it causes embolism that impairs water transport from the soil to the leaves and, if uncontrolled, may even lead to plant mortality via hydraulic failure. What happens in the phloem, however, is less clear because measuring phloem transport is still a significant challenge to plant science. In all vascular plants, phloem and xylem tissues are located next to each other, and there is clear evidence that these tissues exchange water. Therefore, drought should also lead to water shortage in the phloem. In this review, theories used in phloem transport models have been applied to drought conditions, with the goal of shedding light on how phloem transport failure might occur. The review revealed that phloem failure could occur either because of viscosity build-up at the source sites or by a failure to maintain phloem water status and cell turgor. Which one of these dominates depends on the hydraulic permeability of phloem conduit walls. Impermeable walls will lead to viscosity build-up affecting flow rates, while permeable walls make the plant more susceptible to phloem turgor failure. Current empirical evidence suggests that phloem failure resulting from phloem turgor collapse is the more likely mechanism at least in relatively isohydric plants.},

We monitored stemwood nonstructural carbohydrate (starch and sugars) concentrations of the dominant tree species at three sites in the northeastern United States. We estimated the mean age of the starch and sugars in a subset of trees using the radiocarbon (14C) bomb spike. With these data, we then tested different carbon (C) allocation schemes in a process-based model of forest C cycling. We found that the nonstructural carbohydrates are both highly dynamic and about a decade old. Seasonal dynamics in starch (two to four times higher in the growing season, lower in the dormant season) mirrored those of sugars. Radiocarbon-based estimates indicated that the mean age of the starch and sugars in red maple (Acer rubrum) was 7?14 yr. A two-pool (fast and slow cycling reserves) model structure gave reasonable estimates of the size and mean residence time of the total NSC pool, and greatly improved model predictions of interannual variability in woody biomass increment, compared with zero- or one-pool structures used in the majority of existing models. This highlights the importance of nonstructural carbohydrates in the context of forest ecosystem carbon cycling.},

@article{Pruyn:2005aa,
	abstract = {Two coniferous tree species of contrasting sapwood width (Pinus ponderosa L., ponderosa pine and Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb., Douglas-fir) were compared to determine whether bole respiratory potential was correlated with available storage space in ray parenchyma cells and/or respiratory substrate concentration of tissues (total nitrogen content, N; and total non-structural carbohydrate content, TNC). An increment core-based, laboratory method under controlled temperature was used to measure tissue-level respiration (termed respiratory potential) from multiple positions in mature boles ({$>$}100-years-old). The most significant tissue-level differences that occurred were that N and TNC were two to six times higher for inner bark than sapwood, TNC was about two times higher in ponderosa pine than Douglas-fir and there was significant seasonal variation in TNC. Ray cell abundance was not correlated with sapwood respiratory potential, whereas N and TNC often were, implying that respiratory potential tended to be more limited by substrate than storage space. When scaled from cores to whole boles (excluding branches), potential net CO2 efflux correlated positively with live bole volume (inner bark plus sapwood), live bole ray volume, N mass, and TNC mass (adjusted R2 ≥0.4). This relationship did not differ between species for N mass, but did for live bole volume, live bole ray volume, and TNC mass. Therefore, N mass appeared to be a good predictor of bole respiratory potential. The differences in net CO2 efflux between the species were largely explained by the species' relative amounts of whole-bole storage space or substrate mass. For example, ponderosa pine's inner bark was thinner than Douglas-fir's, which had the greater concentration of ray cells and TNC compared with the sapwood. This resulted in ponderosa pine boles having 30--60{\%} less ray volume and 10--30{\%} less TNC mass, and caused ponderosa pine net CO2 efflux/ray volume and net CO2 efflux/TNC mass to be 20--50{\%} higher than Douglas-fir. In addition, because inner bark respiratory potential was 2--25 times higher than that of sapwood, ponderosa pine's thinner inner bark and deeper sapwood (relative to Douglas-fir) caused its bole net CO2 efflux/live bole volume to be 20--25{\%} lower than that of similarly-sized Douglas-fir trees.},

	abstract = {Plasticity in structural and functional traits related to water balance may determine plant performance and survival in ecosystems characterized by water limitation or high levels of rainfall variability, particularly in perennial herbaceous species with long generation cycles. This paper addresses whether and the extent to which several such seasonal to long-term traits respond to changes in moisture availability.Using a novel approach that integrates ecology, physiology and anatomy, a comparison was made of lifetime functional traits in the root xylem of a long-lived perennial herb (Potentilla diversifolia, Rosaceae) growing in dry habitats with those of nearby individuals growing where soil moisture had been supplemented for 14 years. Traditional parameters such as specific leaf area (SLA) and above-ground growth were also assessed.Individuals from the site receiving supplemental moisture consistently showed significant responses in all considered traits related to water balance: SLA was greater by 24 {\%}; roots developed 19 {\%} less starch storing tissue, an indicator for drought-stress tolerance; and vessel size distributions shifted towards wider elements that collectively conducted water 54 {\%} more efficiently --but only during the years for which moisture was supplemented. In contrast, above-ground growth parameters showed insignificant or inconsistent responses.The phenotypic changes documented represent consistent, dynamic responses to increased moisture availability that should increase plant competitive ability. The functional plasticity of xylem anatomy quantified in this study constitutes a mechanistic basis for anticipating the differential success of plant species in response to climate variability and change, particularly where water limitation occurs.},

@article{Pfautsch:2015aa,
	abstract = {Not long ago, textbooks on plant physiology divulged the view that phloem and xylem are separate transport systems with exclusive functions. Phloem was flowing downwards providing roots with carbohydrates. Xylem transported water upwards from roots to leaves. This simplified view has changed forever. Today we have a much-refined understanding of the complex transport mechanisms, regulatory functions and surprisingly ingenuous solutions trees have evolved to distribute carbohydrates and water internally to fuel growth and help mediate biotic and abiotic stresses. This review focuses on functional links between tissues of the inner bark region (i.e., more than just phloem) and the xylem, facilitated by radially aligned and interconnected parenchyma cells, called rays. Rays are usually found along the entire vertical axis of tree stems, mediating a number of transport processes. We use a top-down approach to unveil the role of rays in these processes. Due to the central role of rays in facilitating the coupling of inner bark and xylem we dedicate the first section to ray anatomy, pathways and control mechanisms involved in radial transport. In the second section, basic concepts and models for radial movement through rays are introduced and their impacts on water and carbon fluxes at the whole-tree level are discussed. This section is followed by a closer look at the capacitive function of composite tissues in stems where gradual changes in water potential generate a diurnal `pulse'. We explain how this pulse can be measured and interpreted, and where the limitations of such analyses are. Towards the end of this review, we include a brief description of the role of radial transport during limited availability of water. By elucidating the strong hydraulic link between inner bark and xylem, the traditional view of two separate transport systems dissolves and the idea of one interconnected, yet highly segregated transport network for carbohydrates and water arises.},

	abstract = {Stems that develop secondary vascular tissue (i.e. xylem and phloem derived from the vascular cambium) have unique demands on transport owing to their mass and longevity. Transport of water and assimilates must occur over long distances, while the increasing physical separation of xylem and phloem requires radial transport. Developing secondary tissue is itself a strong sink positioned between xylem and phloem along the entire length of the stem, and the integrity of these transport tissues must be maintained and protected for years if not decades. Parenchyma cells form an interconnected three-dimensional lattice throughout secondary xylem and phloem and perform critical roles in all of these tasks, yet our understanding of their physiology, the nature of their symplasmic connections, and their activity at the symplast--apoplast interface is very limited.

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to increase both pest insect damage and the occurrence of severe drought. There is therefore a need to better understand the combined effects of biotic and abiotic damage on tree growth in order to predict the multi-factorial effect of climate change on forest ecosystem productivity. Indeed, the effect of stress interactions on tree growth is an increasingly important topic that greatly lacks experiments and data, and it is unlikely that the impact of combined stresses can be extrapolated from the outcomes of studies that focused on a single stress. We developed an original manipulative study under real field conditions where we applied artificial defoliation and induced water stress on 10-year-old (∼10 m high) maritime pine trees (Pinus pinaster Ait.). Tree response to combined stresses was quantitatively assessed following tree secondary growth and carbohydrate pools. Such a design allowed us to address the crucial question of combined stresses on trees under stand conditions, sharing soil supplies with neighboring trees. Our initial hypotheses were that (i) moderate defoliation can limit the impact of water stress on tree growth through reduced transpiration demand by a tree canopy partly defoliated and that (ii) defoliation results in reduced non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) pools, affecting tree tolerance to drought. Our results showed additive effects of defoliation and water stress on tree growth and contradict our initial hypothesis. Indeed, under stand conditions, we found that partial defoliation does not limit the impact of water stress through reduced transpiration. Our study also highlighted that, even if NSC in all organs were affected by defoliation, tree response to water stress was not triggered. We found that stem NSC were maintained or increased during the entire growing season, supporting literature-based hypotheses such as an active maintenance of the hydraulic system or another limiting resource for tree growth under defoliation. We also observed a significant decrease in root carbohydrates, which suggests a shift in the root carbon balance under defoliation. The decrease in carbohydrate supply under defoliation may not counterbalance the carbon use for mineral and water uptakes or a translocation to other tissues.},

@article{Hartmann:2015aa,
	abstract = {Drought-induced tree mortality has received much attention in the recent past. McDowell et al.'s (2008) hydraulic framework links tree hydraulics with carbon dynamics and proposes two non-exclusive mortality mechanisms: carbon starvation (CS) and hydraulic failure (HF). CS is often referred to as the (partial) depletion of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in response to stomatal closure, reduced C assimilation and sustained C storage dependency during longer droughts. HF describes a lethal level of xylem dysfunction from runaway embolism during severe droughts. While HF can be readily inferred from the percentage loss of conductivity in vascular tissues at the time of death, CS is much more difficult to assess.Starvation is usually defined as a lack of food leading to suffering or death. In plants photosynthetic sugars play many functional roles, not only as a source of catabolic energy. For example, sugars are important for osmotic regulation of cell pressure and recent studies suggest a potential link between xylem parenchyma sugars and embolism repair following drought. Hence, carbon limitation could have a direct impact on tree hydraulics and HF; however, empirical evidence for such a mechanism is still inconclusive.Although HF appears to be predominant during drought mortality, our limited understanding of the roles of NSC in hydraulic function precludes any premature refutation of CS as a mechanism in drought-induced tree mortality.},

	abstract = {The pool size of mobile, i.e. non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in trees reflects the balance between net photosynthetic carbon uptake (source) and irreversible investments in structures or loss of carbon (sink). The seasonal variation of NSC concentration should reflect the sink/source relationship, provided all tissues from root to crown tops are considered. Using the Smithsonian canopy crane in Panama we studied NSC concentrations in a semi-deciduous tropical forest over 22 months. In the 9 most intensively studied species (out of the 17 investigated), we found higher NSC concentrations (starch, glucose, fructose, sucrose) across all species and organs in the dry season than in the wet season (NSC 7.2{\%} vs 5.8{\%} of dry matter in leaves, 8.8/6.0 in branches, 9.7/8.5 in stems, 8.3/6.4 in coarse and 3.9/2.2 in fine roots). Since this increase was due to starch only, we attribute this to drought-constrained growth (photosynthesis less affected by drought than sink activity). Species-specific phenological rhythms (leafing or fruiting) did not overturn these seasonal trends. Most of the stem volume (diameter at breast height around 40 cm) stores NSC. We present the first whole forest estimate of NSC pool size, assuming a 200 t ha−1 forest biomass: 8{\%} of this i.e. ca. 16 t ha−1 is NSC, with ca. 13 t ha−1 in stems and branches, ca. 0.5 and 2.8 t ha−1 in leaves and roots. Starch alone (ca. 10.5 t ha−1) accounts for far more C than would be needed to replace the total leaf canopy without additional photosynthesis. NSC never passed through a period of significant depletion. Leaf flushing did not draw heavily upon NSC pools. Overall, the data imply a high carbon supply status of this forest and that growth during the dry season is not carbon limited. Rather, water shortage seems to limit carbon investment (new tissue formation) directly, leaving little leeway for a direct CO2 fertilization effects.},

It has been shown, however, that the use of carbohydrates, a major C storage pool and apparently the main respiratory substrate in plants, strongly declines with decreasing plant hydration. Yet no empirical evidence has been produced to what degree other C storage compounds like lipids and proteins may fuel respiration during drought. We exposed young scots pine trees to C limitation using either drought or shading and assessed respiratory substrate use by monitoring the respiratory quotient, δ13C of respired CO2 and concentrations of the major storage compounds, that is, carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids. Only shaded trees shifted from carbohydrate-dominated to lipid-dominated respiration and showed progressive carbohydrate depletion. In drought trees, the fraction of carbohydrates used in respiration did not decline but respiration rates were strongly reduced. The lower consumption and potentially allocation from other organs may have caused initial carbohydrate content to remain constant during the experiment. Our results suggest that respiratory substrates other than carbohydrates are used under carbohydrate limitation but not during drought. Thus, respiratory substrate shift cannot provide an efficient means to counterbalance C limitation under natural drought.},

Whether cell wall hemicelluloses of non-reproductive plant tissue are multifunctional molecules, which can also serve as carbon sources during periods of enhanced carbon demand, is still equivocal. 3 This review summarizes the current understanding of a possible reserve function of hemicelluloses. Although several descriptive and experimental studies suggested at least partial mobility of cell wall polysaccharides in mature, non-reproductive plant tissues, there is still a need for a broad-scale, ecophysiological exploration of the actual nature of hemicelluloses beyond their structural function. 4 The chemical heterogeneity of hemicelluloses may be the major problem for precise quantitative analyses on a large, comparative scale. 5 Because of the abundant distribution of hemicelluloses in plants, the existence of a significant mobile carbohydrate pool in cell walls of non-reproductive organs would shed rather new light on plant carbon relations in a source-sink context. 6 Consequently, a reserve function of hemicelluloses questions the conventional division of cell compounds into structural (i.e. immobile) and non-structural (i.e. mobile) compounds.},

	n2 = {Abstract Starch and soluble sugars are the major photosynthetic products, and their carbon isotope signatures reflect external versus internal limitations of CO2 fixation. There has been recent renewed interest in the isotope composition of carbohydrates, mainly for use in CO2 flux partitioning studies at the ecosystem level. The major obstacle to the use of carbohydrates in such studies has been the lack of an acknowledged method to isolate starch and soluble sugars for isotopic measurements. We here report on the comparison and evaluation of existing methods (acid and enzymatic hydrolysis for starch; ion-exchange purification and compound-specific analysis for sugars). The selectivity and reproducibility of the methods were tested using three approaches: (i) an artificial leaf composed of a mixture of isotopically defined compounds, (ii) a C4 leaf spiked with C3 starch, and (iii) two natural plant samples (root, leaf). Starch preparation methods based on enzymatic or acid hydrolysis did not yield similar results and exhibited contaminations by non-starch compounds. The specificity of the acidic hydrolysis method was especially low, and we therefore suggest terming these preparations as HCl-hydrolysable carbon, rather than starch. Despite being more specific, enzyme-based methods to isolate starch also need to be further optimized to increase specificity. The analysis of sugars by ion-exchange methods (bulk preparations) was fast but produced more variable isotope compositions than compound-specific methods. Compound-specific approaches did not in all cases correctly reproduce the target values, mainly due to unsatisfactory separation of sugars and background contamination. Our study demonstrates that, despite their wide application, methods for the preparation of starch and soluble sugars for the analysis of carbon isotope composition are not (yet) reliable enough to be routinely applied and further research is urgently needed to resolve the identified problems.

@article{vonArx:2017,
	abstract = {Summary Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) play a crucial role in tree resistance and resilience to drought. Stem sapwood parenchyma is among the largest storage tissue for NSC in mature trees. However, there is a limited mechanistic understanding of how NSC reserves, stem parenchyma abundance and growth rates are interrelated, and how they respond to changing water availability. We quantified NSC, ray parenchyma abundance and ring width along four successive 5-year radial sapwood segments of the stem of 40 mature Pinus sylvestris trees from a 10-year irrigation experiment conducted at a xeric site in Switzerland. Percentage of ray volume (PERPAR) varied from 3·75 to 8·94\% among trees, but showed low intra-individual variability. PERPAR responded positively to irrigation with a lag of several years, but was unrelated to \%NSC. \%NSC was lower in wider rings. However, wider rings still contained a larger NSC pool that was positively related to next year's ring growth. Our results suggest that stem ray parenchyma does not limit NSC storage capacity, but responds to long-term environmental drivers with years of delay. The observed carbon allocation patterns indicate a prioritization of storage over growth independent of growth conditions, likely as a mechanism to ensure long-term survival. Furthermore, NSC pool size proved to be a determinant for the inter-annual autocorrelation in tree-ring growth. Our study highlights the importance of long-term multi-parameter studies to better understand tree responses to environmental variability at different time-scales.

@article{Quentin:2015aa,
	abstract = {Non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in plant tissue are frequently quantified to make inferences about plant responses to environmental conditions. Laboratories publishing estimates of NSC of woody plants use many different methods to evaluate NSC. We asked whether NSC estimates in the recent literature could be quantitatively compared among studies. We also asked whether any differences among laboratories were related to the extraction and quantification methods used to determine starch and sugar concentrations. These questions were addressed by sending sub-samples collected from five woody plant tissues, which varied in NSC content and chemical composition, to 29 laboratories. Each laboratory analyzed the samples with their laboratory-specific protocols, based on recent publications, to determine concentrations of soluble sugars, starch and their sum, total NSC. Laboratory estimates differed substantially for all samples. For example, estimates for Eucalyptus globulus leaves (EGL) varied from 23 to 116 (mean = 56) mg g−1 for soluble sugars, 6--533 (mean = 94) mg g−1 for starch and 53--649 (mean = 153) mg g−1 for total NSC. Mixed model analysis of variance showed that much of the variability among laboratories was unrelated to the categories we used for extraction and quantification methods (method category R2 = 0.05--0.12 for soluble sugars, 0.10--0.33 for starch and 0.01--0.09 for total NSC). For EGL, the difference between the highest and lowest least squares means for categories in the mixed model analysis was 33 mg g−1 for total NSC, compared with the range of laboratory estimates of 596 mg g−1. Laboratories were reasonably consistent in their ranks of estimates among tissues for starch (r = 0.41--0.91), but less so for total NSC (r = 0.45--0.84) and soluble sugars (r = 0.11--0.83). Our results show that NSC estimates for woody plant tissues cannot be compared among laboratories. The relative changes in NSC between treatments measured within a laboratory may be comparable within and between laboratories, especially for starch. To obtain comparable NSC estimates, we suggest that users can either adopt the reference method given in this publication, or report estimates for a portion of samples using the reference method, and report estimates for a standard reference material. Researchers interested in NSC estimates should work to identify and adopt standard methods.},

@article{Mrtinez2016,
	abstract = {Abstract Plants store large amounts of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). While multiple functions of NSC have long been recognized, the interpretation of NSC seasonal dynamics is often based on the idea that stored NSC is a reservoir of carbon that fluctuates depending on the balance between supply via photosynthesis and demand for growth and respiration (the source--sink dynamics concept). Consequently, relatively high NSC concentrations in some plants have been interpreted to reflect excess supply relative to demand. An alternative view, however, is that NSC accumulation reflects the relatively high NSC levels required for plant survival; an important issue that remains highly controversial. Here, we assembled a new global database to examine broad patterns of seasonal NSC variation across organs (leaves, stems, and belowground), plant functional types (coniferous, drought-deciduous angiosperms, winter deciduous angiosperms, evergreen angiosperms, and herbaceous) and biomes (boreal, temperate, Mediterranean, and tropical). We compiled data from 121 studies, including seasonal measurements for 177 species under natural conditions. Our results showed that, on average, NSC account for ~10\% of dry plant biomass and are highest in leaves and lowest in stems, whereas belowground organs show intermediate concentrations. Total NSC, starch, and soluble sugars (SS) varied seasonally, with a strong depletion of starch during the growing season and a general increase during winter months, particularly in boreal and temperate biomes. Across functional types, NSC concentrations were highest and most variable in herbaceous species and in conifer needles. Conifers showed the lowest stem and belowground NSC concentrations. Minimum NSC values were relatively high (46\% of seasonal maximums on average for total NSC) and, in contrast to average values, were similar among biomes and functional types. Overall, although starch depletion was relatively common, seasonal depletion of total NSC or SS was rare. These results are consistent with a dual view of NSC function: whereas starch acts mostly as a reservoir for future use, soluble sugars perform immediate functions (e.g., osmoregulation) and are kept above some critical threshold.

	abstract = {Recent reports on tree mortality associated with anomalous drought and heat have raised interest into processes underlying tree resistance/resilience to water stress. Hydraulic failure and carbon starvation have been proposed as main causes of tree decline, with recent theories treating water and carbon metabolism as interconnected processes. We subjected young plants of two native (Quercus pubescens {$[$}Qp{$]$} and Prunus mahaleb {$[$}Pm{$]$}) and two invasive (Robinia pseudoacacia {$[$}Rp{$]$} and Ailanthus altissima {$[$}Aa{$]$}) woody angiosperms to a prolonged drought leading to stomatal closure and xylem embolism, to induce carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. At the end of the treatment, plants were measured for embolism rates and NSC content, and re-irrigated to monitor recovery of xylem hydraulics. Data highlight different hydraulic strategies in native vs invasive species under water stress, and provide physiological explanations for species-specific impacts of recent severe droughts. Drought-sensitive species (Qp and Rp) suffered high embolism rates and were unable to completely refill xylem conduits upon restoration of water availability. Species that better survived recent droughts were able to limit embolism build-up (Pm) or efficiently restored hydraulic functionality after irrigation (Aa). Species-specific capacity to reverse xylem embolism correlated to stem-level concentration of soluble carbohydrates, but not to starch content.},

Osmolality and sugar composition responses to environmental stresses have been extensively studied for leaves, but less for the secondary phloem of plant stems and branches. Leaf osmotic concentration and the share of pinitol and raffinose among soluble sugars increase with increasing drought or cold stress, and osmotic concentration is adjusted with osmoregulation. We hypothesize that similar responses occur in the secondary phloem of branches. We collected living bark samples from branches of adult Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies, Betula pendula and Populus tremula trees across Europe, from boreal Northern Finland to Mediterranean Portugal. In all studied species, the observed variation in phloem osmolality was mainly driven by variation in phloem water content, while tissue solute content was rather constant across regions. Osmoregulation, in which osmolality is controlled by variable tissue solute content, was stronger for Betula and Populus in comparison to the evergreen conifers. Osmolality was lowest in mid-latitude region, and from there increased by 37{\%} toward northern Europe and 38{\%} toward southern Europe due to low phloem water content in these regions. The ratio of raffinose to all soluble sugars was negligible at mid-latitudes and increased toward north and south, reflecting its role in cold and drought tolerance. For pinitol, another sugar known for contributing to stress tolerance, no such latitudinal pattern was observed. The proportion of sucrose was remarkably low and that of hexoses (i.e., glucose and fructose) high at mid-latitudes. The ratio of starch to all non-structural carbohydrates increased toward the northern latitudes in agreement with the build-up of osmotically inactive C reservoir that can be converted into soluble sugars during winter acclimation in these cold regions. Present results for the secondary phloem of trees suggest that adjustment with tissue water content plays an important role in osmolality dynamics. Furthermore, trees acclimated to dry and cold climate showed high phloem osmolality and raffinose proportion.},

	abstract = {Widespread tree mortality associated with drought has been observed on all forested continents and global change is expected to exacerbate vegetation vulnerability. Forest mortality has implications for future biosphere--atmosphere interactions of carbon, water and energy balance, and is poorly represented in dynamic vegetation models. Reducing uncertainty requires improved mortality projections founded on robust physiological processes. However, the proposed mechanisms of drought-induced mortality, including hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, are unresolved. A growing number of empirical studies have investigated these mechanisms, but data have not been consistently analysed across species and biomes using a standardized physiological framework. Here, we show that xylem hydraulic failure was ubiquitous across multiple tree taxa at drought-induced mortality. All species assessed had 60{\%} or higher loss of xylem hydraulic conductivity, consistent with proposed theoretical and modelled survival thresholds. We found diverse responses in non-structural carbohydrate reserves at mortality, indicating that evidence supporting carbon starvation was not universal. Reduced non-structural carbohydrates were more common for gymnosperms than angiosperms, associated with xylem hydraulic vulnerability, and may have a role in reducing hydraulic function. Our finding that hydraulic failure at drought-induced mortality was persistent across species indicates that substantial improvement in vegetation modelling can be achieved using thresholds in hydraulic function.},

	abstract = {Contents 386 I. 386 II. 388 III. 392 IV. 392 V. 396 VI. 399 399 References 399 Summary Carbohydrates provide the building blocks for plant structures as well as versatile resources for metabolic processes. The nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC), mainly sugars and starch, fulfil distinct functional roles, including transport, energy metabolism and osmoregulation, and provide substrates for the synthesis of defence compounds or exchange with symbionts involved in nutrient acquisition or defence. At the whole-plant level, NSC storage buffers the asynchrony of supply and demand on diel, seasonal or decadal temporal scales and across plant organs. Despite its central role in plant function and in stand-level carbon cycling, our understanding of storage dynamics, its controls and response to environmental stresses is very limited, even after a century of research. This reflects the fact that often storage is defined by what we can measure, that is, NSC concentrations, and the interpretation of these as a proxy for a single function, storage, rather than the outcome of a range of NSC source and sink functions. New isotopic tools allow direct quantification of timescales involved in NSC dynamics, and show that NSC-C fixed years to decades previously is used to support tree functions. Here we review recent advances, with emphasis on the context of the interactions between NSC, drought and tree mortality.},

	abstract = {Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), the stored products of photosynthesis, building blocks for growth and fuel for respiration, are central to plant metabolism, but their measurement is challenging. Differences in methods and procedures among laboratories can cause results to vary widely, limiting our ability to integrate and generalize patterns in plant carbon balance among studies. A recent assessment found that NSC concentrations measured for a common set of samples can vary by an order of magnitude, but sources for this variability were unclear. We measured a common set of nine plant material types, and two synthetic samples with known NSC concentrations, using a common protocol for sugar extraction and starch digestion, and three different sugar quantification methods (ion chromatography, enzyme, acid) in six laboratories. We also tested how sample handling, extraction solvent and centralizing parts of the procedure in one laboratory affected results. Non-structural carbohydrate concentrations measured for synthetic samples were within about 11.5{\%} of known values for all three methods. However, differences among quantification methods were the largest source of variation in NSC measurements for natural plant samples because the three methods quantify different NSCs. The enzyme method quantified only glucose, fructose and sucrose, with ion chromatography we additionally quantified galactose, while the acid method quantified a large range of mono- and oligosaccharides. For some natural samples, sugars quantified with the acid method were two to five times higher than with other methods, demonstrating that trees allocate carbon to a range of sugar molecules. Sample handling had little effect on measurements, while ethanol sugar extraction improved accuracy over water extraction. Our results demonstrate that reasonable accuracy of NSC measurements can be achieved when different methods are used, as long as protocols are robust and standardized. Thus, we provide detailed protocols for the extraction, digestion and quantification of NSCs in plant samples, which should improve the comparability of NSC measurements among laboratories.},

These axial structure?function responses need to be coordinated among competing biophysical constraints to avoid failure of the xylem system. Here, we investigated if ontogeny or experimental manipulation of CO2 and soil temperature influence these structure?function responses. We performed detailed xylem cell anatomical quantification along the axis of 40-year-old Larix decidua trees planted at the Swiss tree line and exposed to a combination of elevated CO2 (+200 ppm) and soil warming (+4$\,^{\circ}$C) between 2001 and 2012. We assessed how mean hydraulic tracheid diameter (Dh), the cell wall reinforcement ((t/b)2), tracheid wall thickness (CWT) and the percent area of ray parenchyma (PERPAR)?proxies for hydraulic efficiency, hydraulic safety, biomechanical support and metabolic xylem functions, respectively?covary along the tree axis. Dh increased from the stem apex to base, strictly following a power function (R2=0.81), independent from ontogeny and experimental treatments. In contrast, axial trends of (t/b)2 and CWT were either influenced by treatment and/or ontogeny, or showed no axial trend (PERPAR). Additionally, we found that a larger Dh only at the stem apex promoted primary and secondary growth. Our approach of analysing xylem anatomical traits along the tree axis and across tree rings provides novel insights into xylem functional architecture and allows reconstructing xylem function over time. We conclude that the maintenance of hydraulic efficiency during ontogeny is very robust, that the tracheid diameter undergoes a strong apical control, and plays a fundamental role for assimilation and tree growth. Instead, the other functional traits more plastically vary with ontogeny and environmental changes. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

	abstract = {Ray parenchyma is an essential tissue for tree functioning and survival. This living tissue plays a major role for storage and transport of water, nutrients, and non-structural carbohydrates (NSC), thus regulating xylem hydraulics and growth. However, despite the importance of rays for tree carbon and water relations, methodological challenges hamper knowledge about ray intra- and inter-tree variability and its ecological meaning. In this study we provide a methodological toolbox for soundly quantifying spatial and temporal variability of different ray features. Anatomical ray features were surveyed in different cutting planes (cross-sectional, tangential, and radial) using quantitative image analysis on stem-wood micro-sections sampled from 41 mature Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris). The percentage of ray surface (PERPAR), a proxy for ray volume, was compared among cutting planes and between early- and latewood to assess measurement-induced variability. Different tangential ray metrics were correlated to assess their similarities. The accuracy of cross-sectional and tangential measurements for PERPAR estimates as a function of number of samples and the measured wood surface was assessed using bootstrapping statistical technique. Tangential sections offered the best 3D insight of ray integration into the xylem and provided the most accurate estimates of PERPAR, with 10 samples of 4 mm(2) showing an estimate within $\pm$6.0{\%} of the true mean PERPAR (relative 95{\%} confidence interval, CI95), and 20 samples of 4 mm(2) showing a CI95 of $\pm$4.3{\%}. Cross-sections were most efficient for establishment of time series, and facilitated comparisons with other widely used xylem anatomical features. Earlywood had significantly lower PERPAR (5.77 vs. 6.18{\%}) and marginally fewer initiating rays than latewood. In comparison to tangential sections, PERPAR was systematically overestimated (6.50 vs. 4.92{\%}) and required approximately twice the sample area for similar accuracy. Radial cuttings provided the least accurate PERPAR estimates. This evaluation of ray parenchyma in conifers and the presented guidelines regarding data accuracy as a function of measured wood surface and number of samples represent an important methodological reference for ray quantification, which will ultimately improve the understanding of the fundamental role of ray parenchyma tissue for the performance and survival of trees growing in stressed environments.},

Comprehensive observations indicate that SG morphologies can be classified into four types: compound grains, bimodal simple grains, uniform simple grains, and a mixed configuration containing compound and simple grains in the same cells. Phylogenetic evaluation of SG morphological diversity indicates that the compound grain type is the ancestral SG morphology in Poaceae, and the bimodal simple grain type is only observed in specific phylogenetic groups that include barley and wheat.

@article{Bischof:2013aa,
	abstract = {The branched glucans glycogen and starch are the most widespread storage carbohydrates in living organisms. The production of semicrystalline starch granules in plants is more complex than that of small, soluble glycogen particles in microbes and animals. However, the factors determining whether glycogen or starch is formed are not fully understood. The tropical tree Cecropia peltata is a rare example of an organism able to make either polymer type. Electron micrographs and quantitative measurements show that glycogen accumulates to very high levels in specialized myrmecophytic structures (M{\"u}llerian bodies), whereas starch accumulates in leaves. Compared with polymers comprising leaf starch, glycogen is more highly branched and has shorter branches--factors that prevent crystallization and explain its solubility. RNA sequencing and quantitative shotgun proteomics reveal that isoforms of all three classes of glucan biosynthetic enzyme (starch/glycogen synthases, branching enzymes, and debranching enzymes) are differentially expressed in M{\"u}llerian bodies and leaves, providing a system-wide view of the quantitative programming of storage carbohydrate metabolism. This work will prompt targeted analysis in model organisms and cross-species comparisons. Finally, as starch is the major carbohydrate used for food and industrial applications worldwide, these data provide a basis for manipulating starch biosynthesis in crops to synthesize tailor-made polyglucans.},

@article{Hoch:2003,
	abstract = {ABSTRACT The current carbon supply status of temperate forest trees was assessed by analysing the seasonal variation of non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in leaves, branch wood and stem sapwood of 10 tree species (six deciduous broad-leafed, one deciduous conifer and three evergreen conifer trees) in a temperate forest that is approximately 100 years old. In addition, all woody tissue was analysed for lipids (acylglycerols). The major NSC fractions were starch, sucrose, glucose and fructose, with other carbohydrates (e.g. raffinose and stachyose) and sugar alcohols (cyclitols and sorbitol) playing only a minor quantitative role. The radial distribution of NSC within entire stem cores, assessed here for the first time in a direct interspecific comparison, revealed large differences in the size of the active sapwood fraction among the species, reflecting the specific wood anatomy (ring-porous versus diffuse-porous xylem). The mean minimum NSC concentrations in branch wood during the growing season was 55\% of maximum, and even high NSC concentrations were maintained during times of extensive fruit production in masting Fagus sylvestris. The NSC in stem sapwood varied very little throughout the season (cross species mean never below 67\% of maximum), and the small reductions observed were not significant for any of the investigated species. Although some species contained substantial quantities of lipids in woody tissues (`fat trees'; Tilia, Pinus, Picea, Larix), the lipid pools did not vary significantly across the growing season in any species. On average, the carbon stores of deciduous trees would permit to replace the whole leave canopy four times. These data imply that there is not a lot of leeway for a further stimulation of growth by ongoing atmospheric CO2 enrichment. The classical view that deciduous trees rely more on C-reserves than evergreen trees, seems unwarranted or has lost its justification due to the greater than 30\% increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the last 150 years.},

	abstract = {Degradation of starch (and of glycogen as well) converts carbohydrates accumulated as metabolically inert storage products back into forms that are usable for various biosynthetic and catabolic routes. Starch and glycogen share their basic biochemistry, but distinct physicochemical and enzymatic differences exist. Structural (dis)similarities of hydroinsoluble starch and hydrosoluble glycogen are briefly discussed. Various types of starch-degrading enzymes and their mode of action are presented. Features frequently observed in starch-degrading enzymes, such as carbohydrate-binding modules and secondary binding sites, are discussed including kinetic implications. Approaches to identify proteins functional in vivo starch degradation and their limitations are discussed. Three types of in vivo starch degradation are distinguished: degradation of transitory starch, mobilization of reserve starch in dead tissue, and that in living cells. Most of the current biochemical knowledge of starch degradation relates to mobilisation of transitory starch. We discuss this process in the context of cellular organisation and location/distribution of starch granules within the cell. Transitory starch degradation is initiated at the granule surface and includes local transitions from a hydroinsoluble ordered to a soluble state. Transition is facilitated by iterating cycles of phosphorylating and dephosphorylating reactions that act on starch-related glucosyl residues. In the stroma, four main products are synthesised by highly interconnected paths and are then exported into the cytosol. Plastidial transporters and cytosolic downstream processes are presented which link starch degradation to biosynthetic or degradative routes all originating from the cytosol. Finally, current views on plastidial transitory starch degradation as controlled by the cytosol are discussed.},

@inbook{DHulst:2015aa,
	abstract = {Plants assimilate carbon during photosynthesis using light energy to reduce atmospheric CO2 and to produce sugars and chemical energy (ATP). Sugars are partly incorporated directly into starch granules in leaf chloroplasts for short-term storage or are exported to non-photosynthetic organs for long-term storage. Indeed, starch accumulation in photosynthetic tissues is transient since it undergoes recurrent cycles of synthesis and degradation following day/night oscillation. Transient starch is synthesized during the day while photosynthesis is active and is degraded at night to provide carbon and energy to the plant when photosynthesis is inactive. Conversely, storage starch accumulates over long periods in storage organs such as seeds or tubers where it is degraded to sustain germination before photosynthesis becomes effective. Transient and storage starch syntheses occur in plastidplastidstroma and involve dedicated enzymatic activities typically supported by several genetically independent isoforms. Although highly similar, both processes hold specific features regarding synthesis and regulation. In this chapter, we describe the mechanism of starch synthesis in photosynthetic tissues (mostly leaves) and its regulation. Several aspects are specifically highlighted here such as: (1) the function of starch synthases for the initiation of starch synthesis and the elongation of the amylopectin- and amylose-forming glucans, (2) the implication of branching enzymes and debranching enzymes for the formation of branch points and the control of their distribution within the polysaccharides, and (3) the regulation of the pathway in leaves especially by the circadian clockcircadian clock, the redoxredoxstate of the cell and the influence of physiological factors, and the formation of protein-protein complexes.},
